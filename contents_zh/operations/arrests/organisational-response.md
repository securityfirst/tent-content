# Organisational Response



If a staff member is arrested and their whereabouts are unknown, the first priority is to establish where they are and under whose authority. Be assertive and visit all relevant local authorities, inform the embassy (in the case of an international staff member) and be very persistent and insistent in seeking information.
  

Remember that a staff member may be arrested for legitimate reasons and may have to account for their actions. Either way, engage a good local lawyer, who knows the local languages and the local system, has experience with this type of situation and perhaps has useful connections.
  

When it is clear who has arrested the staff member and where they are, seek to ensure that their rights are protected. Insist on their right to be visited and to medical and legal assistance, and request improvements in the conditions in which they are being kept, if these are not acceptable. Protest if these requests are not met. It is important to find out from them exactly what happened.
  

People are often arrested without formal charges being brought, in which case insist that a charge is articulated within a specified period of time. The charge may relate to the individual (for example they are accused of being involved in a crime) or the organisation (for example an accusation of spying under cover of humanitarian work). In any scenario the main priority is to work towards the safe and speedy release of the staff member. In most circumstances, only once a staff member is freed from wrongful charges should efforts be made to clear the name of the individual or the organisation.
  

Liaise with, and manage, the staff member's family. Tell them the steps being taken, maintain a direct regular line of communication, remain aware of what steps the family intends or has taken, and warn them if what they plan to do looks like it may be counter-productive.
  

Inform other humanitarian organisations, such as the ICRC, and ask their advice, if appropriate. In many cases, the knowledge that other international organisations are aware of the detention may be enough to persuade the authorities to release the detainee.
