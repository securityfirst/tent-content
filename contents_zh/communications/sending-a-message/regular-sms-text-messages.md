# Regular SMS Text messages

SMS messages are not well encrypted so you should not rely on them to transmit sensitive information securely. Sent SMS messages can be intercepted and kept by your service operator or by third parties with inexpensive equipment. Those messages will carry the phone numbers of the sender and recipient as well as the content of the message. What's more, SMS messages can easily be altered or forged by third parties.

If you do need to use SMS for something, consider establishing a code system between you and your recipients. Codes may make your communication more secure and may provide an additional way of confirming the identity of the person you're communicating with. Code systems need to be secure and change frequently.

Saved messages on your phone can easily be accessed by anybody who gets hold of your phone so consider deleting all received and sent messages straightaway.
