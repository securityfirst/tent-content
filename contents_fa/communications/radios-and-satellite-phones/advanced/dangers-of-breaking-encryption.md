[Title]: # (Dangers of Breaking Encryption)
[Order]: # (3)

Satellite transmissions, while encrypted, are not entirely secure either. Many governments are now capable of defeating encryption

*   You should use code words in highly sensitive transmissions, or avoid satellite phones entirely for such communications.

If your satellite phone is confiscated, authorities or hostile actors can access critical information from its call log, phone book, and sent folder.

*   You should routinely delete call logs and sent folders to protect your sources, and keep the SIM card separate from the phone when not transmitting.
