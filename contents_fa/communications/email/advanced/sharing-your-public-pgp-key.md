[Title]: # (Sharing your public PGP key)
[Order]: # (4)

The tool guides for PGP will explain in detail about how to create your public PGP key and how you might want to share it. In general, it's good to keep in mind that if you are working in a dangerous environment and if would use a pseudonym generally, use that pseudonym (and alternative email) when labelling your key.

Disguising that you are communicating with a particular person is more difficult. One way to do this is for both of you to use anonymous email accounts, and access them using Tor. If you do this, PGP will still be useful, both for keeping your email messages private from others, and proving to each other that the messages have not been tampered with.
