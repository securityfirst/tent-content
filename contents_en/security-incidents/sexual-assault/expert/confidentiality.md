[Title]: # (Confidentiality)
[Order]: # (5)

### Balance confidentiality with transparency as needed to protect the victim, alert others, and investigate the crime. 

## Medical confidentiality

Medical confidentiality makes it possible for the victim to discuss medical and psychological concerns openly and fully. 

*This is often guaranteed by law.*


Where possible, ensure that procedures are in place to preserve the victim’s
confidentiality, privacy and dignity.

## General confidentiality

* **Protect the victim's identity unless they give informed, explicit consent to be identified in that specific context.**

* **Protect the victim's identity if revealing it may put them at risk from the attacker, the community, or from local laws.**

* **Protect incident details to prevent widespread or sensational discussion; share details as needed to alert others or promote legal or internal investigation.**

Victims often feel fear and shame and want to keep their experience as private as possible. Even if it is known that someone on the team has been sexually assaulted, the victim may not want to be identified, and may not want the details to be broadcast. 

Others may find benefit in sharing what happened with the team or with a wider audience in order to hold the attacker responsible and help other victims.

This is the victim's choice. 

Remember: 

*	Victims deserve expert support or counselling when they consider their rights and needs. 
*	Respect the victim's choice even if you have another preference or think you would choose differently. 

## Internal communications

Keep information on a need to know basis. 

(Learn about [managing information](umbrella://lesson/managing-information).)

Discuss protected information where you cannot be overheard, and maintain standards of transparency for information that is public. 

* 	Create a standard response to questions about the incident.
*	Establish policies for horizontal communication with team members and vertical communications with managers or headquarters, if appropriate. 
* 	Agree a code name, a code word or a case number to refer to the victim in place of their name if needed.

## Public communications

If the incident may get press coverage:

*	Prepare the victim. Ensure they have expert support and know what to expect. 
* 	Make them aware that they can choose what information is shared with the media.  
*  Work with journalists to protect the victim's identity unless the victim explicitly gives informed consent to be publicly identified. 

*With the victim's consent, journalists can publish part of the victim's name or use other information to tell their story without naming them if this does not undermine the victim's security.* 

## Alerting others

### Sharing information is vital to ensure others take precautions.

Rape and other sexual assaults, including attempted assaults and threats or intimidation, should be reported to your team and to other teams operating in the area. 

*	Share general, non-personal safety and security incident information to protect the victim's confidentiality. 
*	Write a full incident report for anyone on your team involved in support or legal
proceedings. 
*	Inform the embassy if overseas. 

> *"Without naming what is happening, we continue to stigmatise the
experiences of sexual violence survivors. We send the message that this is an issue we do not want
to speak about, and we create an environment where incidents are more likely to occur."*
