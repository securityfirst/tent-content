[Title]: # (Questioning)
[Order]: # (3)

Authorities may use established techniques to question you.

## Questioning techniques

*   Opening with trivial questions then shifting to sensitive questions when they started you talking.

*   Threatening, then reducing the threat ("good cop, bad cop").

*   Intimidating you.

*   Asking the same questions repeatedly or asking you to describe events backwards to test your consistency. 

*   Claiming others have made allegations or produced evidence against you. Don't voluntarily confirm what they say.

*   Misinterpreting your answers to distort your meaning. Try to check written statements carefully before signing. 

## "Don't believe; don't be afraid; don't ask.” 

Soviet dissidents used to share this advice for undergoing questioning.   

* **Don't believe** what officers say about their intentions ("we will ask you a few questions and let you you go"), or your rights ("if you don't cooperate, we may detain you for 6 months"). 

*Assume that whatever they say is in their interest, not yours.*

* **Don't be afraid** or let yourself be intimidated by threats or the environment. Threats are very often exaggerated to make you panic and cooperate. And fear won't help anyway; knowledge, a strong will and outside help are more useful.

* **Don't ask** for favours. This could reveal a weak spot and give them leverage over you; or they may consider you in their debt, making it harder for you to refuse to cooperate.
