## Warnings

* Recent and past attacks are not an adequate guide to future attacks. 
* Seek objective sources of information. Consider media coverage of attacks in a wider context of expert research and opinion.  
* It is natural to overestimate the threat of terrorist attacks, which are highly visible.

*Don't mitigate threats that are less likely to occur if it stops you from mitigating threats that are more likely to occur.*
