# Watch anyone watching you 

Kidnapping normally takes planning. 

Potential kidnappers may watch the target, their home, or their office before making a move. 

Practising counter-surveillance may make you aware of a plan or an imminent attack.

## Counter-surveillance tips

Counter-surveillance requires *attention* and *knowledge*.

### Knowledge

*	Understand your surroundings.

Learn who belongs, and who does not. 

*   Identify potential choke points on your route.

### Attention

*	Watch for anything unusual.

*	Watch anyone asking unexpected questions or showing unexpected interest in you or your work.

_Potential kidnappers may present themselves as service staff to learn about a home or office, or check the locks while the occupants are absent._

*	Multiple sightings of the same person, vehicle, or activity may indicate surveillance.

_Potential kidnappers may follow the target to identify routines and points to strike._
