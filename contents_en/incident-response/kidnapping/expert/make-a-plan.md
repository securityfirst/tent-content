[Title]: # (Make a Plan)
[Order]: # (15)

# Make a plan and carry it out

## Get advice

*   Decide whether to call in specialist advice, either from police or from a reputable company specialising in hostage negotiations.  

It may help if contact has been made with such a company before any kidnap occurs.  

_Specialist advice from a reputable company is strongly recommended if you lack expertise._

## Get what you need

*   Allocate the necessary human, financial and other resources to ensure that your plan has the best possible chance of success.
*	Create a logbook to record decisions, communications and events;
*   Obtain and mark maps.

## Need to know

*   Keep incident details strictly confidential;  
*	Implement a need to know policy.
*	Bypass the usual chain of command if necessary; 
*	Exempt crisis management team from reporting to usual supervisors. 

## Manage communications

*   Decide whether to negotiate directly with the kidnappers, if that is possible, or appoint an intermediary.

_Using a trusted intermediary gives you time to consider how to respond to messages from the kidnappers, so is often considered preferable._

*   Maintain 24-hour communication channels;
*   Inform local police and other authorities, as appropriate;
*   Provide relevant parties with incident manager's contact details;  
*	Request that no action be taken without the manager's agreement;
*   Keep contact with relevant colleagues or agencies.

## Manage the media

*   Based on the best available advice, make an informed decision about how much information to reveal in order to warn others and sustain action on the victim's behalf;
*   Coordinate messaging with family members and other parties;
*   Appoint a spokesperson and establish strict communication procedure and channels; 
*   Consider whether communications you control could enable the kidnappers or promote their agenda;
*   Share your strategy with editors and work with journalists to manage how the incident is covered, if possible and appropriate. 

"Emotional appeals from family members and hostage tapes from the kidnappers can drive up ransom demands or make it easier for the kidnappers to achieve their political objectives. But I'm hard pressed to come up with a case where the complete suppression of news was essential to the positive outcome in a kidnapping."  
- Joel Simon, "The New Censorship."
