[Title]: # (Seeking help)
[Order]: # (4)

### Sexual assault is a horrible crime.  

*	You are not to blame. The attacker is to blame. 
*	You are not alone. Others have gone through the same experience and can help when you are ready.
* You deserve sensitive and confidential medical treatment.
*	It is your decision whether or not to report the crime.

Victims often feel fear and shame and find it difficult to seek help. But reporting what happened helps you get essential treatment and prevent others from becoming victims. 

## Reporting

Ideally, report the attack:

*	To a supportive ally;
*	To your team;
*	To the appropriate authorities. 

*Someone you trust should accompany and support you if you report the assault to the authorities.*

## Medical evidence

*	A medical examination is strongly recommended before you shower. 

Victims often want to wash, change, and dispose of clothes and other reminders of what happened. But this makes evidence much more difficult to collect.

*You may find you need a police report and medical evidence if you later choose to hold the attacker responsible or obtain medical services.*

## Emotional support 

*	Counselling is strongly recommended for all victims of sexual assault.

*Guidelines on surviving a sexual assault are primarily based
on Western psychological models and talk therapy to put the incident
and your emotions and reactions into perspective. You may deal with the experience differently.*

* Friends, partners, books and online resources can also be supportive.   

*Trans and gender non-conforming victims should be aware that most mainstream support services have been designed for women sexually assaulted by men.*
