[Title]: # (Psychological Support)
[Order]: # (2)

### Create a sense of safety and provide positive support. Ask the victim what they need. 

## Safety

* 	 Ask the victim who they trust and feel most comfortable with. Keep them near that person. 
*	A mature, sensitive team member that the victim trusts should provide the principal support on the team's behalf (not necessarily their manager).
*	Find a place where the victim can rest and recover with a sense of total security. 
*	Ask the victim where they feel safest and most secure.

## Positive support

Immediate emotional responses following rape can vary.

(Learn more about this in [sexual assault advanced](umbrella://lesson/sexual-assault/1).)

Whatever their reaction:

*	Empathise and help the victim identify their emotions. 
* 	Don’t appear overwhelmed or impose your own response.
*	Avoid saying or doing anything that could imply blame or criticism of the
victim. The attacker is to blame. The victim did not ask to be attacked and did not consent.

*	Experiencing sexual assault and rape is disempowering. Always ask, consult and seek consent, rather than
making decisions on the victim’s behalf.

Key messages for the survivors of sexual aggression:

* The attack was not about sex but about power.
* You are not to blame, the assailant is to blame.
* You are not alone. There are people who support and care for you.
* You can survive this and recover from it. It will take time and needs attention, but this is not the end of your life or happiness.

Recommend and facilitate counselling for all victims of sexual assault.

*The available guidelines on surviving a sexual assault are primarily based
on Western psychological models. These are centred on the individual and
concentrate on talk therapy, whereby the survivor is helped to put the incident
and their emotions and reactions into perspective. People with different
cultural backgrounds may deal differently with the experience of sexual
violence. For example, it may affect not only their psychological wellbeing but
also their social future, including marriage. They may seek to forget or repress
the experience as opposed to reframing it, or seek out traditional healing
practices. In offering support, be open and sensitive to other
means of recovery.*
