[Title]: # (Security and reputation)
[Order]: # (0)

### Monitoring your reputation is essential, not out of vanity or for commercial gain, but to inform your security planning. 

Doing the right thing helps, but other factors that are harder to control affect your reputation. 

Adversaries may seek to undermine your reputation for a variety of reasons. 

* To stop others from trusting you;
* To encourage others to investigate, arrest, or harm you;
* To advance political interests;
* To drain your attention and resources;
* To distract the audience from unrelated developments;
* To make money by attracting audiences to online advertisments; 
* Out of boredom or a wish to cause disruption.  

Whatever the reason, damage to your reputation is likely to limit your impact. 

## Security implications

Being discredited may also have serious security implications.

* Risk may escalate quickly because of the way information spreads online. Disinformation is hard to correct, and people far beyond your usual audience may respond to it, even aggressively.
* Campaigns to discredit your work may appear organic, but they may be orchestrated by authorities, or give cover to authorities looking for an excuse to obstruct you.

Whether they cause the climate you work in to deteriorate, or are a sign that others are already actively seeking to stop your work, attacks on your reputation often signal other forms of attack to come.

Negative outcomes of reputational attacks could include: 

* Ineffective messaging or campaigns;
* Blocked funding;
* Loss of credentials or other markers of legitimacy; 
* Physical security incidents (harassment, attack, arrest);
* Inhibited crisis response.
