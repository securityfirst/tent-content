[Title]: # (Documenting disinformation)
[Order]: # (2)

### If you encounter disinformation about you or your work, stay calm, keep records, and try to learn more. 

## Who is responsible? 

* Disinformation is deliberately inaccurate information shared by someone who intends to mislead others. 

* Misinformation is inaccurate information. 

* Rumours involve information of doubtful truth. 

It can be difficult or impossible to isolate the intent and agency behind information circulating in the public domain, espcially online. Be careful not to publicly assign responsibility for negative reports without evidence. 

However, try and trace negative information to the source. Who does it appear to come from? Who is sharing it? Are they who they appear to be, and how can you tell? 

*Widespread misinformation shared by people who believe they are acting in the public interest may look like disinformation, but the security implications are likely to be similar. Don't discount negative information just because it's not clear who is responsible.* 

## Is it coordinated? 

Ongoing, diffusive attacks to discredit individuals or organisations are a hallmark of disinformation. 

Methods may include:  

* Pro-government media and propaganda reports, or false or exaggerated information spread to advance political interests either online and offline; 
* Commentators who are paid to leave online comments intended to distort the truth in order to distract or mislead the public;
* Automated bots programmed to flood a website or online platform with one message or viewpoint, often political;
* Fake news, false or misleading information designed to look like objective, verified news; 
* Real accounts hacked or impersonated to spread false information;
* Leaks of embarassing or sensitive material, real or doctored.

## Seek support

* Don't panic. Negative reports may be upsetting or threatening, but your first step is to learn more about them. 
* Don't try to manage disinformation alone. Friends can help you keep perspective, and team members or other organisations may have experience to help you cope.    

## Keep records

* Store information like dates, account names, screenshots, and the popularity of reports about you in a spreadsheet or folder. 
* Aim to save enough information to reveal patterns or trends and serve as a reference if information or accounts are later deleted. But try to prevent it from becoming a full time job. 
* Consider external storage space if you are saving video or larger volumes of data.

## Report it 

* Local or international watchdog groups and academics investigate disinformation attacks and have resources that may help you;
* Legal advice may help if the information is defamation, slander, or libel, or if someone is impersonating you online; 
* Technology companies may remove content if it violates their terms of service;
* If the content threatens harm or was illegally obtained or distributed by hackers, and if you do not suspect official agencies are a threat, report disinformation to law enforcement, even if you assume they will take no action. It may help to create an official record of the activity you are documenting.
