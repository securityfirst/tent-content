[Title]: # (Dealing with harassment)
[Order]: # (5)

### Response to harassment campaigns depends on many factors, but here are some ideas.  

## Factors to consider 

* Whether the campaign against you is visible or covert;
* Whether publicising harassment could help you or make you more vulnerable;
* Local law and whether you have access to legal advice; 
* Whether there is a risk of serious harm; 
* Whether your allies have resources to support you.

## Possible first steps:  

* Keep records;
* Find out if other people are also being targeted. What does this reveal about who is responsible? Document trends or patterns;  
* Seek expert or professional advice;
* Revisit security plans for crisis and incident response. What is the worst case scenario, and how can you reduce the liklihood it will happen?
* Consider crowdsourcing or fundraising to cover costs, if doing so is legal and will not increase your risk;
* Decide what indicators will signal that the situation has become too dangerous or economically unviable.
