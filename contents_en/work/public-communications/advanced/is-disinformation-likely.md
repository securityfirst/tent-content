[Title]: # (Is disinformation likely?)
[Order]: # (1)

### Disinformation thrives where **access to information is limited or controlled** and **instability heightens the stakes**. 

Understand the areas you operate in to assess the risk that disinformation will affect you or people you work with. 

## Is access to information limited? 

Indicators include: 

* Lack of investment in literacy or media infrastructure;
* Censorship or attacks on the press;
* Biased information due to ownership, laws, or partisan politics.  

## Is instability expected? 

Consider: 

* Elections or political transitions;
* Systemic discrimination and repression;
* Conflict;
* Climate change or natural disasters; 
* Economic downturns. 

## Where could disinformation appear? 

* Identify local media sources that different stakeholders involved in your work consume; 
* Identify social media sites and forums where different stakeholders involved in your work engage; 
* Identify people with influence in your field or community who may comment about you;
* Identify online accounts that comment about you, whether or not you consider them influential;
* Identify your own information gaps (local languages, print publications, radio shows, closed online communities). Can someone you trust help you fill them?   

## Step up security

Disinformation may involve leaks, real or fake, of data that casts you in a bad light. If your security is weak, you may experience significant stress and uncertainty while trying to confirm if a breach has really taken place.  

* Raise awareness and precautions against phishing and social engineering; 
* Increase vetting of people you plan to work with (journalists, consultants, interns, potential funders);
* Tighten password security; 
* Protect your office or workspace from intruders. 

*If someone is orchestrating a campaign against you, they will probe for security weaknesses they can exploit.*

## Plan crisis communications

If you encounter disinformation, would you respond, and what should you say? 

* Who would decide and what time constraints would they be under? If a response is considered necessary, it should be timely. 
* Who should they consult? Will they be available, and how can they be reached?  
* What legal advice do you need to assess possible disinformation or defamation? 
* What conditions would merit a response? 
* Can you find or draft a template for responding to disinformation? 

## Monitor for change 

* Investigate yourself. What information is already public? 
* Set up Google Alerts to be notified of new search hits containing names of individuals or organisations, including different languages and spellings if needed;
* Consider using social media monitoring tools like Hootsuite, Crowdtangle, or GIPHY;
* Explore public relations and brand management resources for ideas and tools to track your reputation.  

## Take regular breaks

* Disinformation is designed to elicit strong reactions, and the conditions that engender it are usually stressful.  
* You may take negative information personally, even if you are just monitoring reports that don't affect you directly. 

*Share the monitoring responsibilities and take care of yourself.*
