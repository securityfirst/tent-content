## Secure communication

Some secure messengers are attached to a phone number or account that may be enough to reveal who you are communicating with, even if what you say is encrypted. 

If potential adversaries in your context include government or intelligence agencies, consider using [Ricochet.im](https://ricochet.im/). It is free, open source software that allows you to exchange end-to-end encrypted messages through the Tor network using a unique address instead of a user name.
