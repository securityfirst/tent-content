[Title]: # (Attending a crime scene)
[Order]: # (0)

This lesson describes how to stay safe when attending a crime scene for work, especially as a journalist.  

Attending a crime scene can be dangerous in many places due to the violent criminal groups that are involved, such as drug cartels or gangs related to organized crime. It’s also risky because journalistic work sometimes comes into conflict with the work of investigative authorities. 

Covering the scene of crimes such as homicide, kidnapping or a shootout calls for security measures to safeguard the safety of journalists and other observers as well as the integrity of the investigation. A reporter has to balance the need to have timely information with personal safety.
