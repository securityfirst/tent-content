# Secure messaging on your computer

Instead of using Skype, Google Talk or MSN Messenger to send messages on your computer we recommend you use one of these secure options instead:

## Pidgin

Pidgin is a secure, free, open source chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on MSN, talking to a friend on Google Talk, and sitting in a Yahoo chat room all at the same time. Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX operating systems. 

Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers, away messages, emoticons, and typing notifications.

## Adium

A good alternative to Pidgin that works with OS X on Macs is [Adium](http://adium.im/).

## Signal Desktop

A desktop version of Signal that runs on Windows, Mac, or LINUX is available [here] (https://signal.org/download/).
