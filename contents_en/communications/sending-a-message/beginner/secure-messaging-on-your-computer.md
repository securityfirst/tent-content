# Secure messaging on your computer

We recommend one of the following for secure messaging on a computer:

## Pidgin

Pidgin is a secure, free, open source chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on MSN, talking to a friend on Google Talk, and sitting in a Yahoo chat room all at the same time. Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX operating systems. 

Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers, away messages, emoticons, and typing notifications.

## Adium

A good alternative to Pidgin for Mac OS is [Adium](http://adium.im/). Learn how to use it in the [Adium tool guide] (umbrella://lesson/adium).

## Signal Desktop

A desktop version of Signal that runs on Windows, Mac, or LINUX is available [here] (https://signal.org/download/).
