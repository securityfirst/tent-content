# Making secure calls on your phone

## Signal

Signal is a free, simple open-source tool for sending secure end-to-end messages and making encrypted phone calls.  It works for both [Androids](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) and [iPhones](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669). It requires that person you are communicating with also has Signal installed.

Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no separate logins, usernames, passwords to manage or lose. It uses your mobile number as your identificator (like a user name) - this makes it easier for the user, though it also makes it easier to analyze the traffic it produces and trace it back to you. Signal uses a central server, which is a point of centralization and thus puts it in the powerful position of having control over some of this data. However they cannot hear your conversations or see your messages, so no one else can either.

You can learn how to set it up simply in the Signal tool guide.

## Ostel

Another notable tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls is OStel. It works on every smartphone (Blackberry, iPhone, Nokia, Android) and every desktop (Mac, PC, Linux, etc). It is one of the most secure means to communicate via voice and comes with many easy set-up wizards for different VoIP services, available [here](https://ostel.co/). (The accompanying app for Android phones is CSipSimple.) Both you and the person you want to talk to will need an ostel account. It securely encrypts all your speech and makes it very difficult to trace your data and find out who you are talking to. If you download CSipSimple from ostel.co it also comes preconfigured for use with ostel, which makes it very easy to install and use.
