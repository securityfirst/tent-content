# Check the Site's Privacy Policy

Remember that information you post on most social media sites does not belong you ? it is subject to the sites own policies and they can use it or share it with others. We know that reading privacy policies is a near-impossible task, but you may want to take a look at sections on how your data is used, when it is shared with other parties, and how the service responds to law enforcement requests.

Social networking sites often collect sensitive information beyond what you actually post?where you are, what interests and advertisements you react to, what other sites you've visited (e.g. through "Like" buttons). Be aware of what you like and repost if they may put you at risk. It can be helpful to block third-party cookies and use tracker-blocking browser extensions to make sure such information isn't being passively transmitted to third parties.

Some social networking sites, like Facebook and Twitter, have business relationships with data brokers in order to target advertisements more effectively. You can see guides that walk you through how to opt-out of these tracking schemes here:
