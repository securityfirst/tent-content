# Think about what you share

Always ask the questions:

*   Who can access the information I am putting online?
*   Who controls and owns the information I put into a social networking site?
*   What information about me are my contacts passing on to other people?
*   Will my contacts mind if I share information about them with other people?
*   Do I trust everyone with whom I'm connected?

Be careful about putting too much information into your status updates ? even if you trust the people in your networks. It is easy for someone to copy your information or unintentionally share something.

It's easy to share a link to a website and get your friend's attention. But who else will be paying attention, and what kind of reaction will they have?
