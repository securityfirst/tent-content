[Title]: # (Hate speech against women)
[Order]: # (2) 

> "[Anonymous online harassment] discourages women from writing and earning a living online. It interferes with their professional lives. It brands them as incompetent workers and inferior sexual objects." Danielle Keats Citron, US lawyer 


Women with visibility on the internet receive a disproportionate amount of abuse because the internet remains a male-dominated space. Women's visibility in online spaces challenges gender inequality and male privilege.

The goal of abusers is to intimidate and silence female commentators to preserve the status quo.

*	Hate speech is directed at journalists, bloggers and activists simply because they are women. 

*	Women are attacked regardless of what they are writing about, but especially if they write about anything to do with women or tackle male-dominated subjects.

*	Women are attacked because of their sexuality and physical appearance, not their ideas. 

*	When the writer is a woman of colour and/or LGBTQI, she will often face hate speech attacking her gender, race/ethnicity and sexuality.

*	Online attacks discourage women from writing, earning a living, and participating in public life on the internet. 

Everyone needs to speak up about the discrimination faced by women online.
