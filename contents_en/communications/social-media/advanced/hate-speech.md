[Title]: # (Hate speech)
[Order]: # (0)

Hate speech is an inexact term, but UN defines it as “any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.”

Hate speech may be written, spoken or visual.

Examples include:

*	Speech that trivialises, glorifies or incites violence against women. 
*	Speech that trivialises the Holocaust. 
*	Speech that glorifies attacks on people because of their race.

Use of the term hate speech may overlap with trolling. Trolls post obscene or inflammatory comments to destabilise debate or attack someone.

[Social media expert](umbrella://lesson/social-media/2) outlines other examples of online abuse. Abuse and hate speech take many forms, so read both lessons to understand the threats people face in online communities.

## Hate speech is not protected speech

*	People of all backgrounds have a right to use their voices and to express themselves however they want.

*	Many of the same people who engage in hate speech that incites to violence are very vocal about their own right to free speech. However, such speech is not protected under the human rights framework. 

*	Freedom of expression does not trump freedom from violence. If abuse is expressed in a particularly aggressive, inflammatory or sustained manner wiith direct violent consequences, then it is considered hate speech and is not protected.
