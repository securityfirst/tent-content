[Title]: # (How to respond to abuse)
[Order]: # (3)

## IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
You may feel helpless, but you can take action. The following strategies have proven useful for other survivors.

## Cut off contact

*	Don't confront the person (online or otherwise); end all contact with them immediately.

*	Filters your email account(s) to block their email address.

*	Block them from your social networking accounts and change the privacy settings to try to keep them accessing from your list of friends.

* 	Change all of your passwords, especially if you think you were hacked.

*	Consider starting new email accounts. Let contacts know that your old accounts were hacked and they should not open any message from them.

* 	Password protect all of your devices.

*	Put a sticker over your webcam.

*	Do a search of your name online or set up alerts to notify you of anything new that involves your name.

*	Paying is unlikely to stop a blackmailer's demands.
 	
## Report it

If more people report tech-related violence, law enforcement and legislators will be forced to take it seriously and develop or improve protocols and laws. 

We recommend doing this if you feel comfortable putting trust in the authorities. 

This will depend on your threat model.

If you go ahead, bring a trusted friend or family member for emotional support.

*Note: When the perpetrator and survivor are located in different countries, jurisdictional issues complicate the case. Fortunately, the number of successful transnational prosecutions is growing.*

## Remove content

If a blackmailer or anyone else distributes your private images without your consent, there are steps you can take.

*	Request that websites take down the information;

*	Contact search engines to remove links to the information;
*	Rebuild a positive online reputation to "bury" the negative search results;
*	Report legal violations to search engines;
*	Make a legal case for defamation;
*	Some people choose to register the images with their national copyright office, which strengthens their ownership claim and allows them to demand removal with legal backing.

## Community support

Sharing your experience may help you and others learn more about online abuse. 

Report incidents to [Take Back the Tech](https://www.takebackthetech.net/mapit/), or look for projects in your region.  

Experiencing and responding to abuse can be isolating and stressful. A supportive community, online or off, can help.
