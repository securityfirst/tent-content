# Protecting Yourself on Social Networks

Social networking sites are some of the most popular websites and tools we use on the Internet. Facebook, Google+, and Twitter have hundreds of millions of users each. With social networking platforms come many benefits, such as the unprecedented opportunity to communicate, publish, coordinate, and persuade. Many people use it for their professional as well personal lives. But, this also means that we're sharing a lot about ourselves online, usually more than we realise. In some cases, this can put our operations, our contacts, or us at risk.

When using social networks it is important to consider:

*   How can I interact while protecting myself, my identity, my privacy and my contacts?
*   What information do I want keep private and who do I want to keep it private from?

Depending on your circumstances, you may need to protect yourself against the social media site itself, against other users of the site, or both.
