# Change Your Privacy Settings

Specifically, change the default settings. For example:

*   Do you want to share your posts with the public, or only with a specific group of people?
*   Should people be able to find you using your email address or phone number?
*   Do you want your location shared automatically?
*   See here for: [How to change your Facebook privacy settings](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/how-protect-your-privacy-facebooks-graph-search)

Remember, privacy settings are subject to change. Be sure to pay attention to these changes closely to see if any information that was once private will be shared, or if any additional settings will allow you to take more control of your privacy.
