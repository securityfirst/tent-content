# Anonymity online on your mobile

## Orbot and Orweb

Orbot is a free proxy app that enables other apps to use the internet more securely. It uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.  
To learn how to install and use Orbot, see the [Orbot tool guide](umbrella://lesson/orbot-&-orweb). 

Orweb is the safest browser on Android. Orbot and Orweb together circumvent web filters and firewalls, and offer a truly private internet connection. Both apps are available for Android and iPhone.To learn how to install and use Orweb, see the [Orweb tool guide](umbrella://lesson/orbot-&-orweb). 

**Remember, these tools can only protect your anonymity if you do not log in to sites or post something online that could identify you!**
