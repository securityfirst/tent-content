[Title]: # (Web-based proxies)
[Order]: # (7)

A web-based proxy is a website that lets users access other websites. It is one of the simplest ways to circumvent censorship.

Find examples at [proxy.org](https://proxy.org/).

## To use a proxy:

1. Enter the URL or web address you wish to view on the proxy webpage; 
2. The proxy displays the content.

## What web-based proxies lack:

*	**Security:** Many are insecure, especially if someone is monitoring your connection.
*   **Privacy:** Many record what users do online.
*	**Performance:** Many do not display pages correctly, especially complex websites, audio and video.
*   **Options:** Only work for webpages, not services like email. 

Some proxy tools offer encrypted connections, or at least use HTTPS. But the proxy provider can still see what you do online, and store information about you. 

*Proxies do not provide anonymity.*
