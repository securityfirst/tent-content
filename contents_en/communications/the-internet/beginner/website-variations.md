# Alternate domain names

Censors using a blacklist may only block one domain name or URL. 

But many sites have variations:

*	Twitter: https://twitter.com;

*	Twitter for mobile: https://m.twitter.com. 

Sites that are routinely blocked may also register more than one name. 

Check if different versions are accessible.
