# Anonymity online on your mobile

## Orbot and Orweb

Orbot is a free proxy app that enables other apps to use the internet more securely. It uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.

Orfox is a browser that uses Orbot to access the Internet using the Tor network on Android. Orbot and Orfox together circumvent web filters and firewalls, and offer a more private internet connection on mobile. Learn how to use [Orbot and Orfox](umbrella://lesson/orbot-and-orfox). 

**Remember, these tools can only protect your anonymity if you do not log in to sites or post something online that could identify you!**
