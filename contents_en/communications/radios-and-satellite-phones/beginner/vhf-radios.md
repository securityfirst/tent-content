[Title]: # (VHF radios)
[Order]: # (6)

*	30 to 300 MHz frequency; 
*	Usually handheld;
*	Communicate over short ranges (handset-to-handset, 2-5km; handset to base, mobile or repeater, 7-15km);
*	Often referred to as "line of sight," but can reach beyond that in many circumstances. 
*	Commonly used brand: Motorola.

## Repeaters

*	Repeaters automatically receive and re-transmit radio signals.
*	Install a repeater to extend Very High Frequency (VHF) signal range. 
*	Repeater systems are reliable and require little maintenance. 

Note:

*	Thick trees and buildings can obstruct VHF signals. 
*	Elevating the VHF antenna may improve transmission range;
*	Before using a VHF radio or repeater, it may be necessary to obtain authorisation from the host government.

### Advantages:

*   Fairly inexpensive;
*   User-friendly;
*   Sturdily built: can be dropped, withstands rain, etc.;
*   Well-positioned repeaters can increase area coverage; and
*   24-hour contact if users are monitoring the VHF.

### Disadvantages:

*   Not secure. Anybody can listen in;
*   Limited battery life (need for spare batteries/ongoing recharge);
*   Badly placed repeaters greatly limit the utility of the network;
*   Hand-held units are frequently lost or stolen;
*   Repeaters are very vulnerable to intentional damage; and
*   Highly dependent on the topography of the area.
