## Install a VPN

If a social network or a section of the Interent is blocked you may be able to access it through a Virtual Private Network. 

## Test different service providers

Carry multiple SIM cards, since not all companies are affected or respond the same way. 

*This may not be advisable if you have to register personal information every time, and the number of SIM cards per person may be subject to limits in some places.*

## Find a wired connection

Make sure you can access a fixed Internet connection if mobile Internet goes down.

## Memorise vital information

Memorise 

* Emergency contact information;
* An escape route to a safe place if there is a chance of violence;
* A place to meet your team if you can't communicate. 

## Identify contacts

Shutdowns are often restricted to a specific area.

* Identify contacts outside your immediate area who can provide help or information if you need it, and arrange to call them over a landline.  

*Only write down information that would not get you or your contact in trouble if someone else found it.*
