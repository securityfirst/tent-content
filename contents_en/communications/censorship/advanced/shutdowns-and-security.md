[Title]: # (Shutdowns and security)
[Order]: # (1)

Internet shutdowns are a security threat. When anyone says they are disabling the Internet to protect you, you are almost certainly less protected. 

* They happen during unrest or uncertainty. 
* They limit your access to trustworthy information about what's going on, and the ability to communicate securely.
* They affect everyone in the area, however vulnerable. 

## Digital security

Shutdowns repeatedly lead people to undermine their own digital safety. 

Many report abandoning basic security principles to stay connected, including sharing SIM cards and passwords.

## Physical security

Shutdowns also heighten physical risk, especially for women and minorities. 

*	Shutdowns change the dynamics on the streets. Crowds may be frustrated, operating on limited or false reports, or just bored and looking for trouble. 
* Women and minorities are more likely to feel unsafe in Internet cafes, international hotels, and the other traditionally male-dominated spaces that may sustain a functioning connection.
