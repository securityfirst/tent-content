# Protection from malware

There are also a number of steps you can take that will help avoid your phone being easily infected with malware. This does not prevent your phone being infected, it just makes it more difficult to infect.

*   The phone operating system: For Androids go to: settings -> About phone -> updates -> check for updates
*   Apps you have installed: In Androids, open the Play store app, from the side menu select My Apps.

Do not accept or install any unknown programmes on your phone, such as ring tones, wallpaper, apps or any others that come from an unexpected source. They may contain malware.

Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free. Learn about how to check in the [Malware lesson](umbrella://lesson/malware/0).
If you don't know or use any of the features and applications on your phone, disable or uninstall them if you can.

Try to avoid connecting to WiFi access points that don't provide passwords.

Make sure communication channels like Infrared (IrDA), Bluetooth and Wireless Internet (WiFi) on your phone are switched off and disabled if you are not using them. Use them only in trusted situations and locations. Consider not using Bluetooth, as it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on this form of communication. Instead, transfer data using a cable.

When setting up your phone, there are a number of settings you can select and apps you can download that will help make your phone more secure. Instructions for set up can be found in the tools section: [Basic Security Setup for Android](umbrella://lesson/android).
