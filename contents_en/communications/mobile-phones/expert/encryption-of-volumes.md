[Title]: # (Encryption of volumes)
[Order]: # (11)

# Encryption of device
If you have an iPhone 3GS or later, your phone should have full device encryption enabled as standard. If you have an Android, you have to turn encryption on in the settings.

# Encryption of volumes

Rooting your phone will also allow you to encrypt its entire data storage or create a volume on the smartphone to protect certain information.

Luks Manager allows easy, on-the-fly strong encryption of volumes with a user-friendly interface. We highly recommend that you install this tool before you start storing important data on your Android device and use the Encrypted Volumes that the [Luks Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nemesis2.luksmanager&hl=en) provides to store all your data.

# Data encryption tools

The Android Privacy Guard (APG) allows OpenGPG encryption for files and emails. It can be used to keep your files and documents safe on your phone, as well when emailing.  

You can learn how to install and use it in the [APG Guide](umbrella://lesson/k9-&-apg) in the tool kit.
