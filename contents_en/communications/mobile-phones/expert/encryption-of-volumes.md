# Encryption of device
If you have an iPhone 3GS or later, your phone should have full device encryption enabled as standard. If you have an Android, you have to turn encryption on in the settings. (Learn [Basic Security Setup for Android](umbrella://lesson/android).)

# Data encryption tools

The [Open Keychain] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain)  allows OpenGPG encryption for files and emails. It can be used to keep your files and documents safe on your phone, as well when emailing.

Rooting your phone will also allow you to encrypt its entire data storage or create a volume on the smartphone to protect certain information. [Cryptonite](https://code.google.com/p/cryptonite/) is another open source files encryption tool with more advanced features on it, and specially prepared for rooted Android phones with a custom firmware.
