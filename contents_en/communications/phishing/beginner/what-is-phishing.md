[Title]: # (What is Phishing?)
[Order]: # (1)

Phishing attacks try to trick people into revealing information or downloading malware that can be used to spy on them or disrupt their work. (Learn more about [Malware] (umbrella://lesson/malware).) A phishing message pretends to be trustworthy in order to get you to perform an action like clicking on a link, opening an attachment, installing software, or entering your login credentials. 

Phishing messages can be sent by email, SMS, social media or chat services, including Skype, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, or WhatsApp. 

Spear phishing attacks use personal information about their target audience to make the message more convincing. You are more likely to click on a bad link if it looks like your boss sent it, or enter your bank details into a form that appears to belong to your bank.

The bad news is that phishing campaigns are cheap and easy to run. The good news is that they are not usually sophisticated. They rely on you to make simple, preventable mistakes. Learn to prevent them in this lesson.
