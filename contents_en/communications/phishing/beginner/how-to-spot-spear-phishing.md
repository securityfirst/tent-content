[Title]: # (How to Spot Spear Phishing)
[Order]: # (3)

Targeted attacks are called spear phishing. These attackers research the target and design messages specifically to trick one individual or community. Spear phishing messages can be difficult to spot, but attackers still make small, telltale mistakes. 

If you might be at risk of attack, or you communicate with others who might be at risk, be cautious of any unexpected message asking you to open an attachment or click on a link—even one from somebody you trust.  

If someone you know falls victim to a phishing attack, the attacker may use their account to contact you over email, social media, or chat. Check the tone of messages. Does your friend sound like 
themselves? Do they make unexpected mistakes? If an account is compromised, your instinct may be the only thing that stops you from clicking on a bad link.   
 
If you are suspicious, contact the sender to check if the message is real. But make contact through a different channel to prevent the attacker from responding. For example, call or send a secure chat message to check a suspicious email. Doing so has helped people avoid some of the most elaborate spear phishing attacks.
