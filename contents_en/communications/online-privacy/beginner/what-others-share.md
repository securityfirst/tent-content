# Set boundaries

Other people can give away sensitive data about you.  

Your friends can make their connections to you public in a variety of ways, by tagging, mentioning or interacting with you.

Talk to your friends about what you feel comfortable sharing.

# Privacy is not retroactive

You may have the option to untag yourself, or ask someone else to take it down, but this depends on the platform. Once published, information is hard to control. 

# When your boundaries are violated
