[Title]: # (HTTPS)
[Order]: # (6)

### Other people can intercept unencrypted communications sent over your web browser, including sites you visit and email content.

These could include:

*	People using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or café; 
*	People at your office or school; 
*	Your internet service provider; 
*	Malicious hackers; 
*	Government or law enforcement officials. 

## What is HTTPS? 

When you visit a secure website, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in your browser's address bar should begin with HTTPS:// rather than HTTP://

If it does, and if your browser does not display any errors, then you should be communicating through an encrypted connection between your browser and the server where the website is hosted. 

HTTPS traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLS is used to protect other online services, as well, and is the most common way to encrypt data between a device and a server. 

HTTPS is now quite common, and you will rarely see a major website that does not support it.

## Use HTTPS Everywhere

Even if your webmail uses HTTPS by default (they should): 

*	Always check for https:// before logging in. If you only see http://, add "s" and refresh the page. 

* Download the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) browser add-on for Firefox or Chrome.

## Check STARTTLS Everywhere

If you use a mail client like Thunderbird, Apple Mail or Outlook, you will not be able to check the address bar for HTTPS://. But you can still use TLS encryption. In fact, most reputable email providers require this. 

Go to [STARTTLS Everywhere](https://starttls-everywhere.org/) to learn how your current provider measures up when communicating with other mail servers.
