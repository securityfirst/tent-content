# For advice on how to practice counter-surveillance when on foot, go to the Advanced lesson.

There are a number of indicators that might let you know if a vehicle is being used to conduct mobile surveillance.

Look out for:

*   Common vehicles for the area ? a team will try to use the most inconspicuous vehicle for the local environment
*   Unusual aerials
*   Modified boxes on top
*   Equipment in the car ? Maps, radios, GPS, binoculars, cameras etc.
*   Rubbish in a car
*   Parking for quick exit
*   Windows left slightly open
*   ?Boot fit?
*   One or at most two people in a vehicle
*   Radio operator talking into a radio
*   Two people in a stopped car talking but not apparently to each other
*   Leaving an engine on unnecessarily
*   Brake lights being activated when a vehicle is stationary
*   Don?t forget taxis, rickshaws or expensive looking cars.

**Identifying Teams**  

If you identify one potential surveillance member, you can use that knowledge to identify others. Members of a surveillance team can cross-contaminate other members:

*   By looking in their direction
*   By using hand signals
*   By parking their car or stopping in the same place (e.g. they have relieved each other)
*   By poor discipline/drills/boredom and pulling their cars up alongside each other in order to have an unnecessary conversation.
