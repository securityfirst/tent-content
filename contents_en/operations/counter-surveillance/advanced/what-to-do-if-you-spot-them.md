# Be discreet 

If you suspect surveillance, do not react or raise the surveillance team's suspicions. 

**Remember, your goal is to find out whether you are being followed, not to lose them.**

# Take action 

If you confirm you are under surveillance, you have three options:

1.	**Change your plans (safe, recommended)** 

This allows you to: 

*	Keep your original plan secure;
*	Convey that your activity is not worth surveillance.

2.	**Lose the surveillance covertly:** 

If you must stick to your plan, and if you feel it is safe: 

*	Lose the surveillance team *without* them knowing that thay have been made;
*	Make it look accidental. 

3.	**Lose the surveillance overtly (risky):** 

If it is absolutely vital to lose the surveillance, and it is not possible to do so covertly.

*	Lose the surveillance team *even if* it makes them aware that they have been made.  

However, this action: 

*	Confirms that you don't want to be watched;
*	Increases the likelihood of further surveillance.
