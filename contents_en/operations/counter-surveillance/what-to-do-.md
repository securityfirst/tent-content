# What To Do If Your Office Is Under Surveillance

*   **Consider the risks**Confrontation with suspicious people should be done with caution, before doing so, consider the risks. For example, what might that person be doing? What is the past history of threats against your organisation or yourself? Is it likely that they will attack you immediately if you confront them or is it more likely that they will just leave and send someone else? If you confront someone they are likely to be replaced by another (unknown) agent, and you then lose the benefit of being able to monitor the surveillance being carried out against you.
*   **Increase protection**Increase your office protection by reducing the ability of an adversary to conduct surveillance. For example by putting up screening near your building, using CCTV and/or guards, closing blinds, locking gates, selecting sites which are not easily overlooked, strict access controls to your building etc.
*   **Continue monitoring**Continue to monitor the general security environment and increase your observation of threats during periods of higher tension ? e.g. protests, elections, sensitive national holidays etc.
