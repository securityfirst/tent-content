# Tactics: Chokepoints

Chokepoints are areas that anyone following you must pass through, and so allow for better observation and filtering of potential surveillance. Some naturally occurring chokepoints could be:

*   Small relatively deserted laneway/alleyway with few paralleling lanes/roads
*   Traffic lights
*   Roundabouts
*   Road junctions
*   One way streets
*   Car park entrances/exits
*   Toll booths
*   Quiet roads
*   Long straight roads
*   Road works

If using a roundabout as a chokepoint, try to record up to 10 of the vehicles following the vehicle which is potentially under surveillance  ? Try to note the registration and description (colour, make, model, unique descriptive features, number of occupants, presence of radios etc.) This is because a handover to another car may take place here ? so another person would now have the target in their line of sight. 

Look for a handover: When turning, look for vehicles (or people on foot) who might match the profile of surveillance team members but then continue straight.
