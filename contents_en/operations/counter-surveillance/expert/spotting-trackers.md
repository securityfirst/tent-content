# Spotting Trackers

A tracker is a device placed on a car to monitor its location. This is often used by surveillance teams instead of physically following a person's car.

Some trackers (particularly those used by government agencies) allow the surveillance team to track a target in real time and to monitor historical paths. Some trackers only log the journey taken by the target vehicle. They do not allow the surveillance team to track the vehicle live - instead the tracker must be retrieved by the team and analysed on a laptop.

You should be particularly aware of the risk of trackers if you think your work is of interest to the authorities and your car is kept in a publicly accessible areas at any time. You should regularly check your car for trackers and particularly before going to any sensitive meetings.

Trackers are usually placed on the base of a car using magnets. They can also be placed in the boot or roof. You need to get right under the car and feel around corners with your hands to do a proper check.

Trackers can be the size of a phone or even smaller. They can also be covered in tape or oil to help disguise it as part of the car.
