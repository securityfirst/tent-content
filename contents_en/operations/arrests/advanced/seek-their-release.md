[Title]: # (Seek their release)
[Order]: # (1)

## Understand the situation

*	Communicate with the person who was arrested as soon as you can.
*	Find out from them exactly what is happening.

## Protect their rights

Insist on your team member's rights to be:

*	Visited; 
*	Given medical and legal assistance;
*	Well treated and kept in acceptable conditions;
*	Released if not charged within a specified timeframe. 

Protest if these requests are not met. 

*As a matter of principle, women should be held
in accommodation which is physically separate from that
of male prisoners, in order to protect them against sexual
harassment and abuse.*

## Seek their release

The arrest may relate to the person's actions or the organisation they work for.

Your first goal is to work towards their safe and speedy release (if there is no legitimate reason for the arrest). 

After that is obtained, consider whether you need to restore the reputation of the person or the team.
