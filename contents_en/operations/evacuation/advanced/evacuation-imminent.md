# Phase Three - Evacuation Imminent

When evacuation is imminent the office should usually suspend most normal operations to concentrate on evacuation preparations.  Potential evacuees may be relocated to a pre-selected safe area, or work from home.  Remote staff should be recalled or relocated.  Staff currently outside the region should remain in a safe place.  Non-essential personnel and family members may be evacuated.  Tasks during this phase, which may last weeks or only a few hours, include:

*   Keep all staff fully informed.
*   Coordinate closely with embassies, other NGOs, the UN, and other agencies as appropriate.
*   Pay salaries to local staff, with salary advances if possible
*   Hide high-value property which will remain. Remove any organisation logos from vehicles which may be stolen. Ensure you keep copies of serial numbers of high-value equipment.
*   Give clear instructions regarding responsibilities and leadership roles to those staff staying behind.  Establish a means of continued communication between remaining staff and those evacuating. Provide authorisation documents to key national staff, if necessary.
