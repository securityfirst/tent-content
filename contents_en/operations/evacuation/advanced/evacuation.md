# Phase Four - Evacuation

Once evacuation or relocation has begun, it should take precedence over all other activities. The field office may continue operations through national staff, or contractors if appropriate, or may close completely.  Considerations during evacuation may include:

*   If there is a risk of looting, consider disabling radios, equipment and vehicles. Empty and leave open all safes.
*   Ensure effective communication with national staff left behind.
*   All evacuees move to pre-designated assembly area.
*   Evacuate by the safest means possible, maintaining good order and remaining in communication with all groups evacuating.
*   Once evacuation is complete, inform HQ, relevant embassies, and key national staff.

The evacuated personnel may manage operations from outside the country, communicating with and working through the national staff (or contractors) if possible. If a decision is made to close the office completely, care will be needed to ensure humane and correct termination or reassignment of staff contracts and the disposal of assets.
