# Planning questions

## Who? 

Who is eligible for evacuation or relocation assistance?

Who leaves first? 

For example, in a large organisation: 

*   **Priority 1:** Family from overseas;
*   **Priority 2:** Team members in immediate personal danger;
*   **Priority 3:** Any team member who is not essential;
*   **Priority 4:** Everyone left. 

## Where?  

Identify:

*	A first choice destination;
*	An alternate destination.  

_Organise a safe house if needed._ 

Do you need a visa? What will you need when you arrive? 

(Learn more about this in [preparation](umbrella://lesson/preparation).) 

## How?

Plan your route: 

*	Choose an emergency meeting point;

How will you notify your team when to meet? 

*	Choose your route;

*	Choose how you will travel.  

(Learn about [vehicles](umbrella://lesson/vehicles).) 

_Ensure the route is open in emergency conditions._ 

## What?

Inventory information and equipment or assets. 
  
Identify what to: 

*	**Take:** Essential or sensitive documents and equipment. 

*	**Leave:** Non-essential, non-sensitive documents. 

If high-value equipment will remain, how will it be hidden or protected?  

*	**Destroy:** Non-essential, sensitive documents or notes.

_If in doubt, destroy information that could put those evacuating at risk if seized by an adversary._

## Who is responsible?  

Clearly define who will do, and take, what.

## What will be the impact?

Will you be able to continue working remotely, or return later?  

Will local groups or contractors continue your work? 

What policies do you need in place for that to happen?
