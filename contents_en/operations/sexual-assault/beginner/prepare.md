### If you are responsible for a team: 

## Create a policy

Guidelines for responding to sexual assault and harassment must be clear,
documented and readily available.

### Harassment

* Clearly define what is considered to be harassment and share it with your team;
* Encourage awareness of the context and appropriate precautions.

### Assault

Clearly state:

*	What protection and support you will facilitate in specific contexts (if you work for an organisation, this could involve repatriation, relocation (temporary or permanent), legal support, and compassionate leave);
*  How you will reconcile the need for confidentiality with theatened to alert others to the threat.

(Learn more about this in [sexual assault expert](umbrella://lesson/sexual-assault/2).)

## Seek training

Your team must be able to mobilise expert and effective support if one of you is sexually assaulted. Develop this expertise through training and simulation, or identify external sources.

## Identify medical and legal professionals

Connect with specialist advice in advance of a potential crisis. Before an incident occurs, identify: 

*	A reliable and experienced lawyer; 
* 	A recognised medical professional, preferably a woman.  

## Locate contraception and medication

*	Are post-coital contraception and other specialised medication readily available from medical institutions in the area? 
* If not, ensure that they are at hand in the office and can be dispensed under
medical supervision, or that a victim can be transported immediately to
somewhere where they are available. 

## Brief your team in advance

*	Inform everyone early about the risk of rape and other assessed risks (e.g. before they sign a contract, rather than before they depart).
* Discuss the threat of rape and appropriate precautions regularly to prevent the subject from becoming taboo.
* Learn what support they find most appropriate, especially in different cultural contexts.
* Sensitise men to the risks and stress women experience in high-risk areas.
