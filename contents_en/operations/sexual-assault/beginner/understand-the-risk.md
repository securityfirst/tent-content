[Title]: # (Understand the risk)
[Order]: # (1)

### Everyone is a potential victim of sexual assault. 

## Basic facts

*	Sexual assault is a crime of violence and control. 
*  	People of all ages, ethnicities and economic groups are at risk.
* Sexual assault is the most under-reported violent crime.
*	Victims are usually pre-selected.
*  The perpetrator is often an acquaintance. 

## Specific risk analysis

Sexual assault can occur in any society at any time, but is a higher risk in some places, at some times, and for some people. 

Conduct a risk analysis to:

*	Identify places, times, situations and categories of people at higher risk. 
*	Understand local legal and medical responses to sexual violence and identify resources. 

## Resources

*	Local women’s groups; 
*  	Human rights organisations and lawyers; 
*	Community workers, such as religious workers or long-term aid workers; 
*	Security focal points at embassies;
*	Local authorities; 
* 	Local health centres.

*If appropriate for the context, consider asking for general information, like statistics about sexual assault rates, to gauge the level of awareness and sensitivity about the issue.*
