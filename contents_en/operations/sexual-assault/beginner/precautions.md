[Title]: # (Precautions)
[Order]: # (2)

### Preventive measures can reduce the likelihood of becoming a target. 

## Training

Empowering self-defence training will equip you to resist attackers using forceful and non-forceful measures (such as blocking and fleeing), and help you understand which measures to apply in different contexts, including when you know your assailant.   

## Dress

*"Sexual violence incidents can happen regardless of the clothing being worn and are never the fault of the survivor."* Megan Nobert, Addressing Sexual Violence in Humanitarian Organisations: Good Practices for Improved Prevention Measures, Policies, and Procedures, Report the Abuse, August 2017.

* Appropriately for the culture;
* Inconspicuously;
* Modestly; 
* In loose clothing;

*Consider a heavy belt and boots that are hard to remove.*

## Accessories

*	Wear a head scarf if appropriate;
*  Wear a wedding ring, whether real or fake;
*  Avoid necklaces, ponytails, or anything that can be grabbed. 
*	Minimize makeup or jewelry to avoid unwanted attention.
*	Carry equipment discreetly, in a nondescript bag.

*Consider carrying pepper spray or even spray deodorant to deter aggressors.*

### Offenders will usually wait until a victim is vulnerable or isolated.

## Trusted companions
 
* Travel and work with friends, colleagues or support staff (like translators).
* Vet local services and support staff carefully.
* Keep in regular contact with your team. 

## Behaviour

* Appear familiar with the environment;
* Appear confident; 
* Avoid striking up conversation or making eye contact with strangers. 
* Gestures of familiarity such as hugging or smiling, even with colleagues, can be misinterpreted and raise the risk of
unwanted attention. 
* Women should stay near the edges of predominantly male crowds and
have an escape path in mind. 

## Alcohol

* Drinking too much makes you vulnerable to sexual assault and other threats;
* Drinks have been drugged or spiked prior to sexual assault; 
* Don’t accept drinks from strangers or recent acquaintances; 
* Be acutely aware of your surroundings in drinking venues;
* Never leave your drink unattended.

## Accommodation

*	Choose a hotel with security guards whenever possible
* 	avoid rooms with accessible windows or balconies. 
*  Use all locks on hotel doors
*  consider using your own lock and doorknob alarm. 

## Avoid risk

* Avoid staying in remote areas without
a trusted companion; 
*	Avoid unofficial taxis or taxis with multiple strangers; 
*	Avoid using elevators or corridors
where you would be alone with strangers; 
*	Avoid eating out alone, unless you are sure of the setting; 
* Avoid spending long periods alone with men you don't trust. 

## Communications

*	Compile and share contact information for your team and support staff. 
*	Carry security numbers, including local emergency contacts. 
*	Avoid giving out personal information.
*	Have a cover story prepared if you are getting unwanted attention (“I’m waiting for my colleague to arrive”).
*	Get language training and discuss with others what you should say or do if threatened. 

*Knowing some sentences in a local language may be critical in changing the intent of a potential assailant.* 

### Recognise your own emotional strengths and limitations.

## Are you comfortable with your own level of risk? 

*	Can you cope with the risk? Are you prepared to move forward with your plan?
* Would you be able to survive emotionally and recover from sexual assault?
*	Will you observe security measures intended to control
the risk, even if they feel like an infringement of your personal liberty or of
equal rights?
*	Consider discussing the risk with your partner and establish mutual
expectations in case of an incident.
