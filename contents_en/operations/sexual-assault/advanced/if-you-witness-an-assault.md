[Title]: # (If you witness an assault)
[Order]: # (6)

### Witnesses will have to deal with their own emotions, and will also require support.

*	Other people may be prevented from stopping sexual assault. Being unable to prevent a rape is in itself a deeply shocking experience. 

*	Assailants may force other people to witness the rape taking place.

This risk is real, and awareness and preparedness are needed.  

## If someone else is under under threat of rape:

*	Stay together. Insist that you cannot leave them alone.
* 	Try to reason with assailants if something else can be offered to forestall
the intended aggression.

## Protect and preserve life 

*	Desist if resistance becomes life-threatening. No one is helped if you are killed.
* 	If you provoke violence, there is a greater chance that it will be used during or after the rape.
*	Focus on preparing yourself mentally to help and support the rape victim when the attack is over. 

*Concentrating on how best to support the rape survivor immediately after the attack can be a strong coping mechanism.*
