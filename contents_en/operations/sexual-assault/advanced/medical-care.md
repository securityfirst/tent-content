[Order]: # (5)

A medical professional should conduct tests for sexually transmitted diseases and provide treatment for any injuries.

*Someone you trust should accompany and support you.*

## Post-coital contraception

Post-coital, or emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) can be administered within 72 hours of intercourse. 

*Do not wait to take a pregnancy test.*

## Sexually transmitted diseases

*	Medication can prevent chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomonas. 
*	You can be vaccinated for Hepatitis B if you haven't been vaccinated or previously infected.  
 
### HIV

*	If it is not known whether the assailant is HIV-positive, assume he was. 
*	The risk of contracting HIV increases if penetration was violent and caused tissue damage. 
* 	No preventive medication is 100% effective.

**Medication may still be beneficial.** Start *as soon as possible* after possible exposure to HIV and no later than 72 hours after, and continue for four weeks.
