[Title]: # (If you are assaulted)
[Order]: # (2)

### There is no single response when threatened with sexual assault, but there are options. Use your best judgment. 

Remember the threat may build up gradually and that the assailant may be someone you know. 

## Passive resistance

Do or say something to change the attacker's mind or ruin their desire for sexual contact.

* Consider shouting something unexpected such as, “Is that a police car?”
* Consider dropping, breaking, or throwing something to startle the attacker. 
* Consider urinating or soiling yourself.
* If you are using an unfamiliar language, study phrases you could say to alter the situation.

## Active resistance

Use physical force to fight off the attacker or resist being taken to another location.  

*	Scream, shout for help, blowing the car horn, run away.
*  	Fight back, such as with a knee to the attacker’s groin.
*	Use self-defence skills to fight off attackers.

*Some experts believe that fighting off an attacker could increase the risk of fatal violence. Consider the number of assailants, whether weapons are involved, and whether the setting is public or private.*

## Submit

If there is no way out and your life is in danger, your objectives should be: 

1. Survival. Protect and preserve your life in the face of sexual assault. 
2. Minimise physical and psychological harm done during the sexual assault or rape.

This may mean submitting, and not resisting physically.

*If sexual assault follows arrest or kidnapping, you may have limited options. Developing a rapport with your guards or captors may reduce the risk of all forms of assault. Protecting your life is the primary goal.*
