It is important to keep control of the flow of the meeting. After introductions you should begin by mentioning security to the person: agree on your alternate time and place for the meeting if a problem occurs; let them know what you can and cannot do to help them if there is a problem; agree on a discreet signal in case there is a problem.

Avoid ordering meals and pay for what you do get straight away and in cash ? This avoids your identification and allows you to make a speedy exit if needed.

Observe people who enter after the person you are meeting, as well as anyone who sits close to you ? use knowledge of surveillance teams to assess them. Always trust your instincts ? prepare to leave immediately if you feel something is not right.

Avoid incriminating yourself. If possible, avoid writing on paper ? you can always ask for details to be sent via encrypted email later. (See the Email lesson for advice on how to send encrypted email.) If notes are necessary, try not to write anything sensitive in the first ten minutes and in general keep the amount of sensitive notes you take/actually record to a minimum whenever possible. Consider using codenames (esp. for testimony or sensitive information). When finished with your notes, always remember to destroy them safely and dispose of it in places away from the meeting location. Do not let waitresses or waiters overhear your conversation.
