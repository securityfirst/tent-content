## Have a media strategy 

Create clear objectives for approaching the media and keep them in mind during every approach.

- Maintain a database of journalists and outlets to engage with;

- Create a “media map” describing who covers what;

- Dedicate trained team members to public affairs and media engagement; 

- Use the media to target different stakeholders, e.g. government
officials; 

- Use the media to start a public conversation about urgent issues.

## Preempt bad coverage

You may need to avoid or counter negative propaganda as part of your work. 

- Refine your editorial styles. Use short, concise sentences. 

- Always publish accurate information and show yourself to be impartial;

- Whenever possible, emphasise positive steps taken by people in authority;

- Build a positive narrative about your work;

- Work with journalists to find a common cause or common ground;

- Establish relationships with journalists who specialise in your area, or trustworthy professionals who will make use of evidence you collect; 

- Use live broadcasts so others can see what you are doing directly.

## Attract good coverage

### Make it easy
