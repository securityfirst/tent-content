# Dealing with Crushes

Crushing in crowds or police charges can be dangerous even as a bystander. You can mitigate the danger by taking the following precautions:

*   Ensure there are good working communication channels between the team and everybody's location is known at all times.
*   Unless specifically planned to cover from amongst crowd, retreat to a safe vantage point, e.g. an upstairs window of a nearby building with permission of the owner.
*   Park vehicles in accessible location, positioned for easy departure. Plan positions including emergency escape routes & fallback plans.
*   Take second person and stay alert to changes in situation - leave if crowd behaviour becomes unpredictable.
*   Wear clothing & footwear that will enable easy movement around any debris. Do not wear high heels or sandals / open toed shoes.
