# Dealing with Crushes

Crushing in crowds or police charges can be dangerous even as a bystander. You can mitigate the danger by taking the following precautions:

*   Take someone else with you. 
*   Ensure there are good working communication channels between everyone in your team, and that everybody's location is known at all times.
*   Unless you absolutely need to be in the crowd, retreat to a safe vantage point, e.g. an upstairs window of a nearby building with permission of the owner.
*   Park vehicles in accessible location, positioned for easy departure. Plan positions including emergency escape routes and fallback plans.
*	Stay alert to changes in situation and leave if crowd behaviour becomes unpredictable.
*   Wear clothing and footwear that will enable easy movement around any debris. Do not wear high heels or open toed shoes.
