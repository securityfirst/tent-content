# Preparing Your Phone

To protect your rights, you may want to harden your existing phone against searches. (Learn more about security and **[Mobile Phones] (umbrella://lesson/mobile-phones).**)

*   **Passwords:** Always password-protect your phone. While password-protecting your phone is a small barrier to access, please be aware that it is not an effective barrier to expert forensic analysis.
*   **Encryption:** Activate encryption on your phone. If you have an Android, go to Settings -> Personal -> Security -> Encryption. (Learn how to [Encrypt your iPhone] (umbrella://lesson/encrypt-your-iphone).)
*   **For communicating**: Signal (Learn how to use Signal for [Android] (umbrella://lesson/signal-for-android) and [iOS] (umbrella://lesson/signal-for-ios).) 
*   **For video/photography:** ObscuraCam and the related plugin, CameraV (Learn how to use [ObscuraCam] (umbrella://lesson/obscuracam).)
*   **For emergencies:** Panic Button (Android only)

**Back up your data:** It's important that you frequently back up the data stored on your phone, especially if your device lands into the hands of a police officer. You may not get your phone back for a while (if at all) and it is possible that its contents may be deleted, whether intentionally or not.

**Keep an emergency number:** Consider writing one important, but non-incriminating phone number on your body with a permanent marker in case you lose your phone, or are in police custody but are permitted to make a call.

**Use a throwaway:** You should also consider bringing a throwaway or alternate phone to the protest that does not contain sensitive data, which you've never used to log in to your communications or social media accounts, and which you would not mind losing or parting with for a while. If you have a lot of sensitive or personal information on your phone, or you need to conceal your presence at the protest, this might be the best option for you.
