[Title]: # (Security and safety)
[Order]: # (0)

### The goal of security management is to protect yourself, your team, and your work. 

## Security 

Security measures aim to prevent harm or loss from intentional acts, like violence or crime.

## Safety 

Safety measures aim to prevent harm or loss from unintentional acts, like accidents, natural disasters, or illness.

This lesson describes steps you can take to manage security by developing a security plan, but don't isolate security considerations from safety considerations. Your security goals are undermined if safety is compromised. 

*Every missed safety measure is a potential win for your adversaries.*
