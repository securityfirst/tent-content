### Security measures aim to prevent harm or loss from intentional acts, like violence or crime.

### Safety measures aim to prevent harm or loss from unintentional acts, like accidents, natural disasters, or illness.

This lesson describes steps you can take to manage security by developing a security plan, but don't isolate security considerations from safety considerations. The goal of security management is to protect yourself, your team, and your work. That goal is undermined if safety is compromised. 

### Every missed safety measure is a potential win for your adversaries.
