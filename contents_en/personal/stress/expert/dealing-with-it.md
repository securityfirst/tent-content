### PTSD can be treated, even when it develops years later. 

Most symptoms of traumatic stress improve naturally in a few weeks. 

## Seek treatment

See a doctor if symptoms: 

*	Are severe and disruptive;
*	Continue for more than four weeks. 

A doctor may refer you to an expert or mental health specialist.

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the severity and duration of symptoms. 

An expert may recommend:

*   **Watchful waiting** to see if symptoms improve without treatment;

*   **Psychotherapy** such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT);

*   **Antidepressant medication.**

## Social and cultural context

*	Some cultures are more resistant than others when it comes to recognising PTSD. If there is little awareness of the issue: 
	* Find supportive allies;
    * Consult online resources;
    * Ask for what you need. 

### Language about mental health may not reflect how stress is understood and managed everywhere. 

*	Is there a concept of stress and trauma in the culture? How do people experience it, identify it and describe it?

*	How has it been dealt with traditionally and historically, and who would deal with it?

*	What is the nature of stress and trauma today, and how has it changed from before?

*	What coping strategies are currently being pursued and why, and how effective are they?

*	What resources can be used to address current needs?
