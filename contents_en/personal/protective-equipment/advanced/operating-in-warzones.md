[Title]: # (Combat zones)
[Order]: # (1)

### In combat zones or if embedded with the military, wear body armor rated to withstand shrapnel and high-powered bullets. 

## Body armor

Choose a vest according to the expected threat. 

The U.S. National Institute of Justice six-tier rating system is used by most manufacturers around the world. 

*	Choose a vest rated to stop high-velocity bullets fired by military rifles if you are covering armed conflict.

*	Consider gender-specific designs and whether you require options such as side or groin protectors.

*	Body armor products are periodically updated as newer, lighter, and more reliable materials are developed.

_No vest is completely bulletproof. One may still be severely injured or die from the trauma of blunt impact, even if the body armor does stop the projectile._

## Helmets

Helmets are recommended in war zones, mainly to provide protection against shrapnel.

_Even a top-rated helmet is likely to be penetrated by any direct hit from a bullet fired by an assault or sniper rifle._

## Inspect body armor 

Damage can weaken material intended to protect from ballistic threats.

*	**Kevlar** is a strong, synthetic material used in body armor. It can degrade if it gets wet or sweaty, or suffer damage which cannot be seen by the naked eye. 

*	**Ceramic plates** used in body armor may break if dropped from a height. 

Store body armor properly and ensure a trained professional inspects it regularly.
