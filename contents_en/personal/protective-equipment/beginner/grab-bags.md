[Title]: # (Grab Bags)
[Order]: # (5)

### A grab bag contains the essentials you need to leave rapidly. 

Prepare a grab bag at times of heightened risk.

## Where to keep it

*	Keep a grab bag close to an exit where you can grab it and run.

*	Plan out several potential escape routes in case of emergency. 
	*	Different routes may be better at different times (e.g. across the roof at night, or over a fence in daylight). 
  *	Move grab bags to the best location whenever necessary.
