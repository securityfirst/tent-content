*   Discuss Standard Operating Procedures prior to departure
*   Agree before you travel on an itinerary and communication schedule. This should be given to a trusted colleague or family member who is not travelling with you and will be responsible for liason and management of any security issues or support.
*   You should carry your 'constant companion' on your person at all times. A constant companion includes some cash, your key documentation needed for evacuation, and a list of emergency names, addresses, phone numbers, and the names of reputable hotels along the route.
*   Only minimal data should be brought with you - it should be backed up and, if appropriate, encrypted.
*   If carrying sensitive information decide how to discreetly carry it in to the country.
*    What's your story? Prepare to answer questions at airports and elsewhere. (For advice on both of these, see the [Borders lesson](umbrella://lesson/borders))
*   If any sensitive meetings are to be held, or meetings with vulnerable human rights defenders, follow the advice laid out in the [Meeting lesson](umbrella://lesson/meetings).
*   Have an alternative plan to exit the country. Do you have a 'stand-by' visa for a neighbouring country?
*   If driving or being driven in a vehicle, follow the advice laid out in the [Vehicles lesson](umbrella://lesson/vehicles).
*   You should understand tools, systems and techniques for good personal security management, counter-surveillance, safe use of email etc. (training might be necessary) This may include making yourself familiar with the advice in the [Arrest and Kidnapping lessons](umbrella://lesson/kidnapping).
*   Inform authorities and embassies of the trip.
*   Will a curfew be respected? Will solo movement be allowed?
