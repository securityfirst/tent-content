[Title]: # (Civil Unrest)
[Order]: # (3)

### In cases of street clashes or violence, wear an inconspicuous anti-stab vest.

## Riot gear

*	Lightweight and relatively thin anti-stab vests provide protection against knife attacks, rubber bullets, and other hazards. 

*	Baseball-style bump caps are available with metal plates. 

Wearing gas masks or other body armor may be appropriate, but also increase the risk that others will mistake you for a demonstrator or police.
