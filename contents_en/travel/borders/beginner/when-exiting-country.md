[Title]: # (When Exiting Country)
[Order]: # (3)

When leaving the country, the same principles as entering apply.

## Know your cover story

A cover story about what you have been doing should be:

*   Simple;
*   Easily repeatable;
*   Verifiable.

## Prepare for anything

*   Assume you will be searched. 
*	Assume that anything written will be read or copied.
*   Confiscation of your equipment is a possibility. 

	*	Back up files remotely. 
    *	If necessary, keep a small USB stick or microSD card somewhere harder to find.

(Learn about [backing up](umbrella://lesson/backing-up), [safely deleting](umbrella://lesson/safely-deleting), and [protecting files](umbrella://lesson/protecting-files).)
