## Don't be predictable.

50% of abductions take place while the victim is in their car, often in the early morning, within 400 meters of the target's home or office.

*	Travel by different routes at different times.

*	Vary routine during travel, work, and recreation.  

*	Roadblocks or car accidents may be staged to provide cover for abductors disguised as officials.
