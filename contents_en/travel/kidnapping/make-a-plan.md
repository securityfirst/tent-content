Difficulty:Expert

*   Make a plan. Will you negotiate directly with the kidnappers, if that is possible?  Or will you appoint an intermediary?  (A trusted intermediary is often thought preferable, to give time for decision-makers to consider their responses to any messages from the kidnappers.)
*   Decide whether to call in specialist advice, either from the police or from a reputable company specialising in hostage negotiations.  It may help if contact has been made with such a company before any kidnap occurs.  If you are not sure that you have the necessary expertise to handle a kidnapping, specialist advice from a reputable company is strongly recommended.
*   Allocate the necessary resources ? human, financial and other ? to ensure that your plan has the best possible chance of success
