*   **Be cautious**  
Don't make yourself an easy target. This will mean different things depending on the local context but may include walking on foot or driving alone at night. See the Vehicle lesson for detailed security advice for vehicles. At times of heightened risk you should restrict movements to minimum necessary.

*   **Avoid predictability**  
50% of abductions take place while the victim is in their car. The majority take place in the early morning, within 400 meters of home or office, due to a predictable pattern of behaviour. Roadblocks or car accidents may be staged to create a scene where abductors then have a pretext to operate quickly, disguised as officials. Avoid predictability when moving between residences and offices, as well as in off-hours activities, such as taking children to school and going shopping. It may be difficult but try to vary travel times and routes.

*   **Reduce visibility**  
This might mean staff travelling in a trusted taxi rather than an easily identifiable agency vehicle. If there is a suspicion that radio communications may be overheard, staff should not be identified when travelling. Information about movement plans, routes and travel times should be encoded.

*   **Ensure good site security for homes and offices**   
Site protection and strict rules governing the identification of strangers and limits on access complicates the situation for potential kidnappers.
