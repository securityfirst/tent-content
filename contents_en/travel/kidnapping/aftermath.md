*   Regardless of the method of freedom, expect to be immediately and thoroughly debriefed. Cooperate with the authorities, giving as much detail as possible.
*   You will not immediately get all the quietness and privacy you may want. Being kidnapped is a huge psychological ordeal: expect to feel its impact for months and perhaps even years to come, but feel confident that, with the right help, you can recover and get on with your life. See the Stress lesson for more help on this.
