[Title]: # (First Steps)
[Order]: # (14)

**1. Set up a crisis management team in HQ.** 
**2. Appoint a manager to coordinate.** 

_Next steps depend on the circumstances and the manager's assessment of the best course of action._

Consider: 

*   Contacting next of kin.  

Failure to do this quickly can damage the relationship of trust, particularly if news is published first in the media.  

*Lack of trust makes crisis management much harder.*

*   Informing local police and other authorities, as appropriate;
*   Providing relevant parties with incident manager's contact details;  
*	Requesting that no action be taken without the manager's agreement;
*   Answering enquiries from the press
*   Keeping contact with other relevant colleagues or agencies;
*   Providing 24-hour communications;
*	Recording decisions, communications and events;
*   Obtain maps;
*   Ensuring that the crisis management team has sufficient food, water, and rest.
