Malware could allow an attacker to:

* Record from your webcam and microphone;
* Disable your anti-virus; 
* Record your keystrokes; 
* Copy your emails and documents; 
* Search for credit card numbers stored on your device;
* Control or disable other devices you connect to, like smart appliances in your home;

## Types of malware

Most malware is criminal and is used to obtain financial or other valuable information. However, it is also used by governments, law enforcement agencies, and even private citizens to spy on others. 

Types of malware include: 

* Ransomware

Ransomware encrypts your files and demands money in exchange for decrypting them. Making regular backups of your files can greatly limit the damage done by ransomware.

* Stalkerware

Stalkerware is targeted malware that allows attackers to monitor the activities of their victims by obtaining location data, messaging information and access to device features like cameras and microphones. They are most commonly associated with intimate partner violence and stalking.
