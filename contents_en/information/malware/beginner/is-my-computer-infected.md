[Title]: # (Is my computer infected?)
[Order]: # (5)

### Monitor your devices to make sure they are not infected. 

## Use anti-virus software

There are currently no full-featured, open source anti-malware tools, but some anti-virus software or scanners can help combat  the kind of malware used by criminals against hundreds of targets. They are usually ineffective against targeted attacks, such as those carried out by governments.

Examples include: 

* 	[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) for Windows, Mac, and Android;
*   [Avira](https://www.avira.com/) for Windows, Mac, and Android;
*   [AVG](https://www.avg.com/) for Windows, Mac, and Android;
*   [Windows Defender](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/help-protect-my-device-with-windows-security) is built into in Windows operating systems to detect and remove malware; 
*   [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) is a free, open source scanner for Windows and Linux that can detect known malware (it will not monitor your system).  

Most products advertised as "anti-malware" for iOS are really other types of security tool. 

## Look for other indicators 

### A warning email 
Some services alert you if they believe your account has been targeted. 

### Unexpected activity
You may notice a light indicating that your webcam is turned on when you have not activated it yourself or your settings have been altered to send copies of your emails to an unfamiliar email address.
