## Update, update, update. 

*   Run the latest available version of all software.
* 	Download new security patches immediately.
*   Only download software from official sites.

> Some people think users with an unregistered copy of Windows should not accept security updates. This is not true. 

##  Email

*   Don't click on suspicious attachments or links.  
*   In Gmail, open unusual attachments in Google Drive.
*   Check unexpected emails by contacting the sender through another channel. 

(See the [phishing] (umbrella://lesson/phishing) lesson.)

## Online

*   Watch for browser windows that appear automatically, and read them carefully. 
* 	Close pop-up windows by clicking X in the upper corner, rather than by clicking inside the window.
*   Disconnect your computer from the Internet when not in use and overnight.
