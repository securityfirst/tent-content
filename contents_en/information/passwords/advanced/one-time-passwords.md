[Title]: # (One-time passwords)
[Order]: # (3)

### Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list of one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. 

These are meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you. Each of these passwords works only once, so if one is stolen by spyware when you enter it, the thief won't be able to use it for anything in the future.

There is no way to do this by yourself if you're using a service that doesn't offer it.

### Some services will give you a list of backup codes when you enable 2FA. 

These backup codes never expire, and they are your only way back into your account if you lose access to the device you use to authenticate during 2FA. 

Anybody who has your password can access your account using a backup code, so keep them safe.
