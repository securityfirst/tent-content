[Title]: # (How to make a strong password)
[Order]: # (6)

# Strong passwords are:  

*	Difficult for a computer program to guess;
*	Difficult for others to figure out; 
*	Chosen to minimise damage if someone learns it.

# Seven features of strong passwords:  

## 1. Long 

* **Use more than ten characters, ideally a long phrase or sentence.** 

The longer a password is, the longer it takes to guess. Short passwords of any kind, even totally random ones, are not strong enough for use with encryption today.

## 2. Complex

*	**Include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols.** 

A little effort to make the password more complex goes a very long way. Increasing the length by a few characters, or adding numbers or special characters, makes it much more difficult to crack.

## 3. Random

*	**Don't use your name, telephone number, child's name, pet's name, birth date, or anything personal.** 

Attackers could learn this by doing a little research about you.

## 4. Secret

*	**Do not share your password or let anyone see you type it.** 

If you must share a password, change it to a temporary password first, then change it back. Better still, find another way, like creating a separate account. 

## 5. Unique

*	**Never use the same password for more than one account.** 

Otherwise, anyone who learns that password will gain access to even more of your sensitive information.

## 6. Fresh

*	**Change passwords that may have been compromised.** 

Attackers will continue to use a stolen password until you change it, or may guess a weak password with repeated tries. If in doubt, or if your password is weak, change it. Otherwise, if a password is strong there is no need to change it frequently.

## 7. Memorable

*	**Use paper to protect passwords, not manage them.** 

Don't store multiple passwords on a post-it note on your desk or a file on your computer, even if it's password-protected. But if it helps you to remember a strong, complex password, write it on a piece of paper that you carry with you and protect like a credit card or a passport. Change it if the paper is lost or stolen.
