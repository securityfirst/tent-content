[Title]: # (Secure deletion when discarding hardware)
[Order]: # (4)

# Computers and hard-drives

If you want to finally throw a piece of hardware away or sell it on eBay, you'll want to make sure no one can retrieve your data from it. And even if you're not getting rid of it right away, if you have a computer that has reached the end of its life and is no longer in use, it's also safer to wipe the hard drive before stashing the machine in a corner or a closet. This can be done easily with a tool such as as Darik's Boot and Nuke - there are a variety of tutorials on how to use it across the web, (including here).

# Discarding CD-ROMS

When it comes to CD-ROMs, you should do the same thing you do with paper-shred them. There are inexpensive shredders that will chew up CD-ROMs. Never just throw a CD-ROM out in the rubbish unless you're absolutely sure there's nothing sensitive on it.

# Secure deletion on solid-state disks (SSDs), USB flash drives, and SD cards

Unfortunately due to the way SSDs, USB flash drives, and SD cards work, it is difficult, if not impossible, to securely delete both individual files and free space. As a result your best bet in terms of protection is to use encryption-that way, even if the file is still on the disk, it will at least look like code to anyone who gets ahold of it and can't force you to decrypt it. You can learn about how to use encryption in the [Protecting Files lesson](umbrella://lesson/protecting-files).
