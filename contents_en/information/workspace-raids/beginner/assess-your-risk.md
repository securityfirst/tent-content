[Order]: # (1)

## Assess your risk

* Have people in your area doing your kind of work been raided? 
* Are you at risk of, or could you be accused of, violating local laws? 
* Do you store information that others may seek to access or destroy? 
* Will people be at risk if sensitive information is seized?
* Do you have allies in law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, or the government? 
* Would a raid embarrass the authorities, or further their agenda? 
* How much will your work be disrupted if you lose devices and documents from your workplace or residence?

* Seek legal advice in advance of a raid.  
* Share information with other teams. Investigations or harassment may be part of a wider trend.
