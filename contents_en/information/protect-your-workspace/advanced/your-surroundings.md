### Security considerations extend beyond the rooms and buildings within which you live and work. Protect your data from threats in the surrounding area.

## Get to know your neighbours 

If you are lucky, your neighbours will become allies who can help you keep an eye on your home or office. If not, consider them potential threats. 

## Secure your space

- Review how you secure the doors, windows and other points of entry to your home or office.

- Consider installing motion sensors or CCTV cameras configured to transmit video to an off-site location. This has privacy implications, but it can be an effective way to capture evidence of a burglary or an office raid. Videos should be encrypted, both in transit and wherever they are stored.

- Separate visitors from your regular workspace using reception areas and meeting rooms. (Move documents and equipment into a  private space if you work from home.) Don't allow visitors to access Ethernet or USB ports on printers, monitors, projectors or other devices.

## Secure your Wi-Fi

An attacker who is able to join your wireless network has the same access as one who is able to sneak into your office and connect an Ethernet cable. 

- Set a strong passphrase on your wireless network to stop others from joining or monitoring your traffic. (Look for a *WPA2 password* setting on your router or access point.) If your Wi-Fi relies on a weak password — or no password at all — anyone within range is a potential intruder.

- Name your wireless network something generic that does not reveal anything about your identity, what you do, or where you are.

- Create a separate WiFi network for visitors if you can, to avoid sharing your Wi-Fi password or and prevent them from accessing local devices when they are in range.

## Ignore lost or unfamiliar devices

- Lost storage devices, like USB memory sticks, are a common source of malware. The owner may be carrying malware without knowing it, or they may have been deliberately infected and dropped near your workspace to trick you into plugging it into your device.
