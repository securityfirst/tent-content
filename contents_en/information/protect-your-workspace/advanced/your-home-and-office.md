### Take precautions *both* where you live *and* where you work.

Both criminals and politically motivated attackers may have reasons to target your financial information, sensitive data related to your work or personal details they can use to intimidate, blackmail or impersonate you. 

Criminal and political attacks are often difficult to distinguish, and attempts to obtain sensitive data often look like attempts to steal valuable hardware. 

Below are a few recommendations on how to protect your data within your home or office.

## Set expectations

- Talk to your family and your team about security. Agree on what behaviour you can expect from one another and from visitors.

- Find out what legal protections you have against law enforcement personnel, landlords and others who might try to enter your home or office.

## Use locks 

An intruder with access to your equipment can install malware capable of stealing data in transit or attacking other computers on your network. 

- Consider purchasing a laptop safe or a locking cabinet for sensitive documents and equipment.

- Lock networking equipment like servers, routers, switches and modems inside a secure room or cabinet if possible. Avoid running Ethernet cables outside the building to protect them from tampering.

- Lock your desktop computer case to make it harder for an intruder to get inside. Check if your device has a slot that allows you to attach a padlock, and look for this feature in computers that you buy in future.  

- Use locking security cables where possible to prevent intruders from stealing desktop and laptop computers.

## Resist smart devices

- Televisions, cameras, phones, printers, video game consoles and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices are computers, and they come with many of the same risks. 

*You can cover camera lenses and unplug smart devices when they are not in use. But it is better to think twice before connecting new equipment to your home or office network.*
