[Title]: # (Your physical security policy)
[Order]: # (3)

### What are you currently doing to protect your information? What additional steps can you take?  

Discuss these steps with others, write them down, and revisit them regularly. This is your security policy. Back it up securely.

Your policy should provide: 

* Guidelines for you, people you work with, and anyone new to your team. 

*Most people think about security policies in the context of an organisation or an office, but many of the same principles apply to individuals, families and informal networks.*

* A checklist of actions to take in response to various potential incidents. 

*The stress and chaos of a physical security emergency can make it difficult to respond quickly and appropriately. Having a policy can help prevent paralysis.* 

Give everyone time to read the policy, ask questions, contribute to it, and implement the standards and practices it describes.
