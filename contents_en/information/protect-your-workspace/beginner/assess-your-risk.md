### How might your information might be lost or compromised, and what would the impact be?

## Communication (information in transit)

- List the communication channels you use for work and how you use them. Consider letters, faxes, mobile phones, land line phones, emails, Skype, social media and secure messaging platforms.

## Storage (information at rest)

- List where you store sensitive information for work. Consider computer hard drives, email and web servers, USB memory sticks, external hard drives, CDs, DVDs, mobile phones, printed paper and hand-written notes. 

- List whether each storage device is encrypted and who has access to the keys and passwords needed to decrypt them.

- List where the storage is physically located. Consider the office, at home, your luggage, the recycling bin or, increasingly, "somewhere on the Internet." In this last case, it might be quite challenging to to determine the actual, physical location of a particular piece of information.

- Consider how you destroy sensitive data when you no longer need it. Many shredders work on CDs and DVDs as well as paper documents. Many power drills and most hammers work on hard drives.
