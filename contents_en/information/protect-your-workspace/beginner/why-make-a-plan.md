[Title]: # (Why make a plan?)
[Order]: # (0.5)

We sometimes underestimate the importance of keeping workspaces physically secure. 

Even those who take steps to protect information often fail to write them down. 

Written plans, or policies, take work. But they help us remember small, important details. 

*Many organisations have quality locks on their office doors, but don't keep an up-to-date list of how many keys were created and to whom they were distributed.* 

## Why write a security policy?

Policy documents: 

* Help you reach consensus and share information;
* Help you track your workspace security over time.

Even if you are not working with a formal organisation, it is a good idea to write a security plan.
