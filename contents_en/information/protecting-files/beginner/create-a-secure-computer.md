[Title]: # (Create a Secure Computer)
[Order]: # (3)

### If you need to run programs or communicate, set up a secure computer.

## Keep it cheap
 
*	Buy an older machine. 
*	Check it still support security updates. Some older operating systems may no longer be supported. 

*A computer does not need to be fast or new to run a few programs. Secure software like Tails may be more likely to work with older models. *

## Keep it updated

*	Keep your device or operating system up-to-date with software updates. 

*Updates will often fix security problems in older code that attacks can exploit. *

## Use Tails

* Tails is an operating system with a privacy and security focus.
* Tails defaults to high security settings.
* Tails works well if you just want to store, edit, and write confidential messages, even if you prefer another operating system day to day. 

## Keep it secret

*	Hide your computer in a locked cabinet, or anywhere that will make it obvious if it has been tampered with. 
*  Don't discuss it, or its location. 
*	Encrypt the hard drive with a strong passphrase. If it is stolen, the thief will not be able to read your data without the passphrase.

## Keep it offline 

Keep an air gap between your computer and the Internet. 

*	Don't connect to local networks or Wi-Fi.
*  Copy files onto the machine using physical media, like DVDs or USB drives. 

*The best way to protect yourself from Internet attacks or online surveillance is to never connect to the Internet.* 

## Don’t log in 

If you do connect to the Internet, keep it disconnected from your identity. 

*	Create separate web or email accounts specifically for the device;
*  	Use Tor to hide your IP address from the services you access online. 

*The best way to protect yourself from malware attacks targeting your identity, or someone intercepting your communications, is to keep your secure device completely removed from your usual activities.*

## Back it up

A device for important, confidential information may cause more harm if it is lost or becomes a target. 

*	Encrypt a copy of your data;
* 	Keep the copy somewhere else secure.

*If your adversary would benefit from you losing all your data, don't keep it in just one place, no matter how secure.*
