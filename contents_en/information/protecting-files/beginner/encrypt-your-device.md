[Title]: # (Encrypt your device)
[Order]: # (1)

### Don't assume a locked device is secure. 

You should always lock your device with passwords, PINs, or gestures. 

But this may not protect your data if the device is seized. It’s relatively easy to bypass locks if the data is stored on the device in a format that is easy to access. 

*Adversaries can read or copy data without unlocking a device by accessing the storage directly.*

## Encryption

Encryption enhances security by scrambling data. 

Only someone who has the right key can unscramble it.
  
If you use encryption, your adversary needs both your device and your key (usually a password) to unscramble the encrypted data. It's safest to encrypt all of the data on your device.
