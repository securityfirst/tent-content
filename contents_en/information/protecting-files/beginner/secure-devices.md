[Title]: # (Secure Devices)

### Cordon off valuable data and communications on a more secure device. 

To maintain a truly secure environment, you have to:

*	Change passwords, habits, and software on your devices;
*  Think constantly about whether you're leaking confidential information or using unsafe practices;
*  Confirm that people you communicate with have strong digital security practices. 

This can be very hard. 

For instance, work colleagues might send you email attachments, even though you know your adversaries could impersonate them and send you malware.

Another solution is to keep sensitive information on a separate, secure device.

## Secure Devices

Secure devices are: 

* Extra devices kept separate from your everyday activity;
* Secret and for occasional use;
* Disconnected from the Internet as much as possible;
* For careful, security-conscious activity only. 

*If you need to open attachments or use insecure software, do it on another machine.*

## Secure Storage

You can store important data that you rarely need to access, like a backp copy, on a hidden, encrypted USB key.
