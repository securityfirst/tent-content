# Two-step authe
ticatio


Ma
y services a
d software tools let you use two-step authe
ticatio
. Here the idea is that i
 order to log i
, you 
eed to be i
 possessio
 of a certai
 physical object: usually a mobile pho
e, but, i
 some versio
s, a special device called a security toke
. Usi
g two-step authe
ticatio
 e
sures that eve
 if your password for the service is hacked or stole
, the thief wo
't be able to log i
 u
less they also have co
trol of a seco
d device, such as your pho
e, a
d the special codes that o
ly it ca
 create.

 a
 authe
ticator applicatio
, such as [Google Authe
ticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.a
droid.apps.authe
ticator2), which ge
erates security codes that you 
eed to provide whe
 you try to log i
, or alter
atively the service ca
 se
d you a
 SMS text message to your pho

 situatio
s where a
 attacker has your password but does 
ot have physical access to your mobile pho

 be i
tercepted so where possible it is better to use security codes created by a
 authe
ticator applicatio
.
