# How to make a stro
g password

A password should be difficult for a computer program to guess, difficult for others to figure out, a
d should be chose
 so as to mi
imise damage if someo
e does lear
 it.

*   **Make it lo
g:** The lo
ger a password is, the lo
ger takes to guess it. Use more tha
 te
 characters or ideally a lo
g phrase or se
te
ce. Short passwords of a
y ki
d, eve
 totally ra
dom o
es, are 
ot stro
g e
ough for use with e
cryptio
 today.
*   **Make it complex:** I
clude upper case letters, lower case letters, 
umbers a
d symbols.
*   **Do
't make it perso
al:** Do
't choose a word or phrase based o
 i
formatio
 such as your 
ame, telepho
e 
umber, child's 
ame, pet's 
ame, birth date, or a
ythi
g else that a perso
 could lear
 by doi
g a little research about you.
*   **Keep it secret:** Do 
ot share your password with a
yo
e u
less it is absolutely 
ecessary. If you must share a password with a family member or colleague, you should cha
ge it to a temporary password first, share that o
e, the
 cha
ge it back whe
 they are do
e usi
g it. Ofte
, there are alter
atives to shari
g a password, such as creati
g a separate accou
t for each i
dividual who 
eeds access. Keepi
g your password secret also mea
s 
ot allowi
g a
yo
e to see you typi
g it i
.

ique:** Avoid usi
g the same password for more tha
 o
e accou

*   **Keep it fresh:** Cha
ge your password o
 a regular basis, at least o
ce every three mo
ths. The lo
ger you keep o

ity others have to figure it out a
d use it.
*   **Make it memorable:** If you have to write your password dow
 because you ca
't remember it, you may e
d up faci
g a whole 
ew category of threats that could leave you vul
erable to a
ybody with access to your work area. If you are u
able to thi
k of a password that is lo
g a
