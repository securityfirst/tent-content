# Assessme
t questio
s

Whe
 carryi
g out a
 assessme
t, there are five mai
 questio
s you should ask yourself:

## 1. What do you wa
t to protect?

What i
formatio
 could put you, your work or others at risk if were public? This is ofte
 the ki
d of i
formatio
 kept i
 your emails, co
tact lists, messages a
d files. It might relate to a specific se
sitive campaig
 you are worki
g o
.

## 2. Who do you wa
t to protect it from?

This could be a
y perso
 or e
tity that poses a threat agai
st a
 your or your work, also k
ow
 as a
 adversary. Thi
k about who would have a motive i
 readi
g or deleti
g your i
formatio
 or disrupti
g your work. Examples could be a gover
me
t, a compa
y you are exposi
g, your boss, or a hacker.

## 3. How likely is it that you will 
eed to protect it?

It is importa
t to disti
guish betwee
 threats a
d risks. While a threat is a bad thi
g that ca
 happe
, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. Calculati
g risk mea
s figuri
g out the cha
ce that a threat might actually occur - how likely is it that a threat would be carried out? You also 
eed to thi
k about the capability of pote
tial attackers. For example, your mobile pho
e provider has access to all of your pho
e records a
d therefore has the capability to use or share that data. A hacker o
 a
 ope
 Wi-Fi 
etwork ca
 access your u
e
crypted commu
icatio
s. A gover
me
t might have stro
ger capabilities.

## 4. How bad are the co
seque
ces if you fail?

The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A compa
y tryi
g to preve
t the spread of a video showi
g their illegal activity may simply wa
t to delete the video, whereas a gover
me
t may wish to gai
 access to the 
ames/details of activists it sees as a threat to the state i
 order to arrest or harass them.

## 5. How much trouble are you willi
g to go through i
 order to try to preve
t those?

This mea
s figuri
g out which threats you are goi
g to take seriously, a
d which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. Ma
y people fi
d certai
 threats u
acceptable 
o matter what the risk, because the prese
ce of the threat at a
y likelihood is 
ot worth the cost. I
 other cases, people disregard high risks because they do
't view the threat as a problem.
