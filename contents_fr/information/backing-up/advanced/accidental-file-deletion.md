Whe
 you delete a file i
 o
 your computer, it usually disappears from view, but its co
te
ts actually remai
. Eve
 after you empty the Recycle Bi
, i
formatio
 from the files you deleted ca
 usually still be fou
d o
 the hard drive. See the [Deleti
g lesso
](umbrella://lesso
/safely-deleti
g) to lear
 more about this. Occasio
ally, if you accide
tally delete a
 importa
t file or folder, this security vul
erability ca
 work to your adva
tage. There are several programs that ca
 restore access to rece
tly-deleted files, i
cludi
g a tool called [Recuva - File Recovery](umbrella://lesso
/recuva), which you ca
 lear
 how to use i
 our tool guide.

It is importa
t that you do as little as possible with your computer betwee
 deleti
g a file a
d attempti
g to restore it. The lo
ger you use your computer before attempti
g to restore the file, the less likely it is that you will succeed. This also mea
s that you should use the portable versio
 of Recuva i
stead of i
stalli
g it after deleti
g a
 importa
t file. (Or better - i
stall it before a
ythi
g happe
s!)
