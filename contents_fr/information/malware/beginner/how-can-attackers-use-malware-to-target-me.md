# How ca
 attackers use malware to target me?

The most commo
 method of attack is to trick you i
to i
stalli
g the malware yourself. There are ma
y ways they try to do this.  

*   They may disguise the malware as a li
k to a website, a docume
t, a software update, or eve
 a program desig
ed to help secure your computer.
*   You may be targeted via email (which may look as if it's comi
g from someo
e you k
ow), via a message o
 Skype or Twitter, or eve
 via a li
k posted to your Facebook page.
*   You ca
 also i
fect your computer by co

ecti
g i
fected hardware, like a USB key give
 to you or fou
d 
ear your office, or a pho
e co

ected to charge.

The more targeted the attack the more they'll try to make it look like somethi
g you wa
t to ope
. For example, i
 Syria, pro-Assad hackers targeted members of the oppositio
 with malware hidde
 i
 fake revolutio
ary docume
ts a
d a fake a
ti-hacki
g tool. A
d i
 Morocco, activists were targeted with malware hidde
 i
 a docume
t made to look as if it had bee
 se
t by a
 Al-Jazeera reporter, promisi

formatio
 about a political sca
dal.

There is also the possibility of someo
