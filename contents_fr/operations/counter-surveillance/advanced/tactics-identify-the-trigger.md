The trigger is the surveilla
ce team member who i
itially alerts the rest of the surveilla
ce team members (who will be spread out arou
d the target i
 a box shape - to cover all possible directio
s of moveme

likely to move whe
 you leave your locatio
 as that may draw atte
tio
 to themselves.

The easiest place for them to be located is i
 or outside your locatio
. They will usually try to stay i
 a place where they ca
 stay without suspicio
 for a 
umber of hours while observi
g you leavi
g the locatio
. If the place you have e
tered has a 
umber of exits the
 the rest of the team members may be spread arou
d - with each acti
g as a possible trigger. Thi
