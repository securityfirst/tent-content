[Order]: # (1)

*   Traveller to ensure they understand how to operate communications equipment.

*   Check phone will function in the country travelled to
*   Bring a satellite phone if necessary (e.g. if phone lines are poor or possibility of censorship during high tensions) - check they are legal in the country you are going to
*   Programme essential numbers into your phone, but not sensitive numbers. Put sensitive numbers into the 'notes' section of your phone but need to disguise them effectively.
*   Additionally, ensure you have key numbers - such as embassies - stored remotely or written elsewhere (coded where necessary).
