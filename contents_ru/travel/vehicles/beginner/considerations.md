[Order]: # (2)

Important issues to take into consideration when planning a journey include:

*   Recent incidents on the route. *Check the Dashboard for information about your area*
*   Weather
*   Length of journey - time of departure/ arrival?
*   Should you travel in convoy with another vehicle?
*   Communications schedule
*   Checkpoints en route - what is the process for passing through? (See Checkpoints lesson for advice on this)
*   Other dangerous points en route (does the route pass through an area controlled by military, a warlord or local leader). Has negotiation been carried out and permissions obtained and understood prior to leaving? Crossings of conflict lines and through insecure areas should be rigorously checked before travelling.
*   Safe 'waypoints' en route
*   Refuelling stops
*   Sustenance/ food stops
*   What is your plan in the event of a car accident or breakdown?
