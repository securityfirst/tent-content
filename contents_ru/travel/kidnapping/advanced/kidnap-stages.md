[Title]: # (Этапы похищения)
[Order]: # (0)

Your main goal if you have been kidnapped is to survive and regain freedom.

How you behave during a kidnapping can increase or reduce the likelihood of survival and regaining freedom. You therefore have some control over the outcome of a kidnapping.

There are five key phases of a kidnap/hostage situation:

1.  Surveillance
2.  Capture
3.  Transport (This could happen several times)
4.  Confinement
5.  Release/ Termination

Prevention measures for stages one and two are dealt with in the Beginner lesson. This lesson will outline survival strategies for capture, transport, confinement and release.
