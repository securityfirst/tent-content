[Title]: # (Захватить)
[Order]: # (1)

The first 15 - 45 minutes are the most dangerous moments in the event; the abductors will be under stress, they are probably armed and most likely to use weapons if resistance is shown. Your objective is to survive, hence:

*   Be calm and cooperative, speak only when spoken to, listen carefully and attentively, avoid sudden moves. Do not behave aggressively or try to be a hero: accept the situation.
*   If in a group, try not to be separated. Appoint one person to speak for the group, selected on the basis of ability rather than formal rank.
*   Do not attempt to escape and or to physically resist.
*   Do not make eye contact it may be mistaken for aggression.
*   Recognise that fear and shock are normal reactions.
