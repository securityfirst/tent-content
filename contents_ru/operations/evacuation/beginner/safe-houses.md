# Safe-houses

Safe-houses take a number of different forms. They can either be emergency safe-houses which are houses or apartments rented specifically for this purpose OR emergency safe havens which are in the already-occupied houses or apartments of friendly people.

Safe-houses and safe havens should be in a relatively anonymous community where neighbours won't be suspicious about what is going on, or in a community where the neighbours can be relied on not to inform.

Safe-houses and safe havens should be in locations which allow observation of approaches to the property. There should be a number of emergency escape routes which are known to all those who may need to stay there. They should ideally have a secure parking place which would make it harder to place a tracker under the car at night. Safe-houses should be secure, with locks on windows, doors and gates and have a good quality alarm system and/or a dog. They should have a modicum of comfort - with appropriate running water, heating and electricity.

Safe-houses that are usually empty should be regularly serviced. Houses should not be left empty for weeks/months on end, as this may look suspicious: post should be collected regularly; the grass should be cut. If the house is unoccupied, non-sensitive activity should occur in the house every few days to make it look occupied. Ideally all rent and bills should be paid using cash to avoid leaving a trace.

Safe-houses and safe havens might need the following:

*   Sufficient supplies of fuel, food, batteries and water for each person to last for a minimum of ten days.
*   Emergency generator
*   Battery or wind up mechanical radio and ideally a TV*   Clothing, especially outerwear appropriate for varying weather conditions
*   Advanced first aid kit with necessary medications as required
*   Flashlights with extra batteries*   Maps and communication plans as appropriate (to plan for emergency evacuation)
*   Fully charged mobile phones and chargers, appropriate credit*   Satellite phone and charger (if issued)*   Sufficient amounts of extra cash
*   Items to reduce psychological stress upon anyone using the safe-house (e.g. books, magazines, board games, games consoles etc.)

All sensitive waste produced at the house should be shredded/ securely burnt and disposed of. Residents should be aware of all possibly incriminating evidence that may be held there: electronic equipment; documents; travel tickets; receipts; or general waste which indicates the number, type or activities of the people using the house.

Emergency grab bags for each person should be located close to the most likely emergency escape routes. See the [Protective Equipment](umbrella://lesson/protective-equipment) lesson for details on what to pack in a grab bag.
