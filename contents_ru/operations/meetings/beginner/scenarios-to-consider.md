# Scenarios to Consider

There are a few scenarios you should play out in your head before you go to your meeting. Some may not put you at any extra risk but it's useful to have thought them through in advance.

*   Will you or they have to travel through checkpoints? If so what is your story?
*   What will you do if are delayed?
*   What if the person is early /late/ arrives unexpectedly with a third party who you don't know or trust?
*   What is your contact plan for if the person doesn't show at all?
*   What if the person is temporarily insecure - someone else is talking to them, they have been stopped by authorities/ recognised/ are drawing attention to themselves?
*   How much information you are going to give the person you are meeting?
*   What if they pass you something (documents/USB etc.)? Where will you put it to keep it out of sight?
*   What do you expect the person's reaction to the meeting to be - fear/ anger/ anxiety?
*   What will you do if you start to get interest from a third party, whether general or threatening?
