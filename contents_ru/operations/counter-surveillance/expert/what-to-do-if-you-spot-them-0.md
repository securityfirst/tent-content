# What to do if you spot them?

The most importa
t thi
g to remember whe
 co
ducti
g cou
ter-surveilla
ce is that you 
eed to be discreet - you do 
ot wa
t a
y pote
tial surveilla
ce teams to k
ow that you are looki
g for them. This would raise suspicio
s further about what you i
te
ded to do. **The primary aim is to ascertai
 whether or 
ot you are bei
g followed, 
ot to lose them.** 

Remember, if you discover you are i
 fact u
der surveilla
ce, you have three optio
s:

*   **Cha
ge your pla
s:**This is the safest a
d recomme
ded optio
 - it will allow you to keep your origi
al pla
s to yourself a
d reassure whoever had you u
der surveilla
ce that you are
't up to a
ythi
g suspicious or worthy of surveilla
ce.
*   **Lose the surveilla
ce covertly:**This is losi
g the surveilla
ce team without them k
owi
g you were aware of them by maki
g it look accide
tal. This should be used if you absolutely must keep your pla
s a
d you feel it is safe to do so.
*   **Lose the surveilla
ce overtly:**This tryi
g to ide
tify or lose the surveilla
ce team i
 a way that makes them aware of what you are tryi
g to do. This is a risky tactic because it co
firms to the team that you are i
te
di
g to do somethi
g that you do
't wa

d so it i
creases the likelihood of you bei

d it is 
ot possible to do so covertly.
