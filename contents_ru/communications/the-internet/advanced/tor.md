# Tor

Tor is free and open-source software that provides anonymity as well as allowing you to circumvent censorship. When you use Tor, the information you transmit is safer because your traffic is bounced around a distributed network of servers. This can provide anonymity, since the computer with which you're communicating will never see your IP address, but instead will see the IP address of the last Tor router through which your traffic travelled.

One of Tor's strengths is that it does not just work with a browser but can be used with various types of Internet software. Email programs, including Mozilla Thunderbird, and instant messaging programs, including Pidgin, can operate through Tor, either to access filtered services or to hide your use of those services.

Tor is the gold standard for secure censorship circumvention. It can be slow and tricky to use. However, it also provides a reliable, secure and public means of circumvention that saves you from having to worry about whether or not you trust the individuals who operate your proxies and the websites you visit. Tor is open source and can be downloaded free online for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.
