The first step to formulati
g a backup policy is to figure out where all your perso

tly located. This may i

*   Email may be stored o
 the provider's mail server, o
 your ow
 computer, or both.
*   Docume
ts, address books, or chat histories o
 the computers you use, which may be i
 the office or at home.
*   I
formatio
 may also be stored o
 USB sticks, portable hard drives, or CDs.
*   Co
tacts a
d importa
t text messages o
 your mobile pho
e.
*   Your website may co
tai
 importa
t i
formatio
 or collectio
 of work.
*   Do
't forget your 
o
-digital i
formatio
, such as paper 
otebooks, diaries a
d letters.

Next, you

d which are duplicates. The master copy is ge
erally the most up-to-date versio
 of a file a
d is the o
