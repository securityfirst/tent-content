# Identifying and organising your information

The first step to formulating a backup policy is to figure out where all your personal and work information is currently located. This may include the following:

*   Email may be stored on the provider's mail server, on your own computer, or both.
*   Documents, address books, or chat histories on the computers you use, which may be in the office or at home.
*   Information may also be stored on USB sticks, portable hard drives, or CDs.
*   Contacts and important text messages on your mobile phone.
*   Your website may contain important information or collection of work.
*   Don't forget your non-digital information, such as paper notebooks, diaries and letters.

Next, you need to work out which of these files are 'master copies,' and which are duplicates. The master copy is generally the most up-to-date version of a file and is the one you will want to back-up.

You should make a table of all the information types you identified above and for each of them note:

*   Whether that information is master copy or duplicate;
*   The device or devices they are stored on;
*   The physical location that the device is usually kept.

This table will help you see which of your information (or master copies) is only in one location and therefore vulnerable.
