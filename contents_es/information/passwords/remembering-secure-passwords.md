# Remembering secure passwords

There are a few tricks that might help you create passwords that are easy to remember but very difficult to guess.

*   **Vary capitalisation, such as:**'My naME is Not MR. MarSter'
*   **Alter numbers and letters, such as:**'a11 w0Rk 4nD N0 p14Y'
*   **Incorporate symbols, such as:**'c@t(heR1nthery3'
*   **Use multiple languages, such as:**'Let Them Eat 1e gateaU au ch()colaT'
*   **Use acronyms:**'Are you happy today?' becomes 'rU:-)2d@y?'

A little effort to make the password more complex goes a very long way. Increasing the length of a password even just by a few characters, or by adding numbers or special characters, makes it much more difficult to crack.
